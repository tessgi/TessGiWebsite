&lt;a href="https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/TESS/TESS+Holdings+Available+by+MAST+Service"&gt;TESS Holdings page at MAST&lt;/a&gt;,
and MAST will make an announcement on social media (@MAST_News on

approximately 20 hours to archive and make available in the MAST
Portal.  Since data files become available immediately after being
archived, during this ingest process the data gradually appear in the
MAST portal and astroquery searches.  After all data are archived,
MAST services such as the bulk downloads, TESScut, and exo.MAST take
another 1-2 days to bring online.  For more information about ingest
and which services are available for each sector, see the

Changes include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new 20-second cadence mode will potentially be available. Once
commissioned, approximately 1,000 target slots per sector will be
available in this mode. Guest Investigator (GI) observations in this
mode will be collected at &lt;a href="proposing-investigations.html#shared-risk-science"&gt;"shared risk"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 10-fold increase in the number of 2-minute cadence targets is
available to the GI program. More than 15,000 target slots will be
available in each sector; a total of approximately 200,000 target
slots are available in Cycle 3, facilitating very large GI programs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The full-frame image cadence is planned to be reduced from 30
minutes to 10 minutes. This change in cadence will be considered
a "shared risk"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new Key Project proposal category is available. These programs
have a maximum duration of 27 months. The programs may be
continued into TESS Cycle 4 and may propose to select targets in
both Cycles 3 and 4 (although only Cycle 3 target lists are solicited
at this time)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ground-based observing focused programs are solicited provided
they support the analysis and/or interpretation of TESS data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large programs and Key Projects have a 5-page limit for the
scientific/technical/management section&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;References are not included in the page limits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Up to 100 ks of Swift time will be available for joint TESS-Swift proposals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting in Cycle 3, proposals aimed at detecting small planets in
2-minute cadence data are solicited&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposals are due on January 16, 2020 at 4.30pm EST.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>We want your newsworthy results for AAS</title><link href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/we-want-your-newsworthy-results-for-aas.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-09-04T13:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-09-04T13:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Knicole Colon</name></author><id>tag:heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov,2019-09-04:/docs/tess/we-want-your-newsworthy-results-for-aas.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The TESS team will be at AAS in January 2020!

The cameras will be oriented along a line of ecliptic longitude (as they were in Year 1), with that longitude determined by the anti-solar longitude at the mid-point of the sector. For most of Year 2, the camera array will be oriented such that Camera 4 is centered on the northern ecliptic pole: in this orientation, the southernmost edge of Camera 1 is ~6° from the ecliptic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, for Sectors 14 and 15, scattered light from the Earth and Moon is predicted to be a significant problem in Cameras 1 and 2, reducing the available observing time for exoplanet transits by as much as 75% in those cameras. To reduce the impact of scattered light, the field-of-view of the camera array will be shifted north by 31° with respect to its nominal pointing in Sectors 14 and 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the cameras are shifted north, the northern ecliptic pole will be located 7° from the center of camera 3, and the southernmost edge of Camera 1 will be at an ecliptic latitude of ~37°.  In addition, with this shift, the fields-of-view of Cameras 3 and 4 will be observing “on the other side of the pole”, thereby providing additional observations of parts of the sky that would otherwise only be observed in Sectors 20-22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scattered light from the Earth and Moon is also expected to be a problem in Sectors 25 and 26 and, to a lesser extent, in Sectors 16 and 24.  The scattered light performance in Sectors 14 and 15 will be reviewed before deciding the instrument pointing in these later sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sky coverage maps for Sectors 1-21 are given below in the ecliptic and celestial coordinate systems.  Two sets of maps are shown below: the upper pair is the sky coverage if Sector 16 is observed at the nominal camera orientation, while the lower pair is the sky coverage if Sector 16 is shifted north.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is the TASC5/KASC12 workshop, being held in Cambridge, MA
from July 22-26. TASC5/KASC12 will be the first meeting where participants have
the opportunity to present analysis and results from asteroseismology
and precision stellar astrophysics of objects in the southern ecliptic
observed by TESS. The workshop will emphasize the most recent results
from TESS, but will also highlight new results from existing data from
the Kepler and K2 missions; the joint meeting is the 5th workshop of
the TESS Asteroseismic Science Consortium and the 12th workshop of the
Kepler Asteroseismic Science Consortium. &lt;a href="http://web.mit.edu/tasc5/index.html"&gt;Additional details about the meeting can be found at its website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second is the TESS Science Conference I, being held in
Cambridge, MA from July 29-August 2. The TESS Science Conference I
will be the first conference dedicated to TESS mission science,
including exoplanets, asteroseismology, stellar binaries, variable
stars, Solar System science (e.g., asteroids and comets),
extragalactic astronomy (e.g., active galactic nuclei and supernovae),
and any other science that can be done with TESS data. The conference
will cover all aspects of the mission, from TESS data analysis,
through follow-up observations, to the impact of discoveries made with
TESS data on theoretical understanding. &lt;a href="https://tsc.mit.edu/"&gt;Additional details about the meeting can be found at its website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third conference relevant to TESS that is happening later this year from November 4-8 at NASA's Goddard Space
Flight Center is Rocky Exoplanets in the Era of JWST: Theory and
Observation. With its large primary mirror and complement of IR
instrumentation, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is poised to
dramatically expand our view of the environments of rocky
exoplanets. JWST will be further aided by the discovery of a new crop
of small planets orbiting nearby low-mass stars and brown dwarfs from
the TESS mission and ground-based surveys, enabling higher precision
measurements over a wider population of potentially rocky worlds. With
these exciting opportunities on the horizon, now is the time to
improve our understanding of what information can be gleaned about
rocky worlds from these future measurements, based on our
understanding of the observations themselves as well as detailed
modeling of the planetary environments that will be
examined. &lt;a href="https://seec.gsfc.nasa.gov/Symposium.html"&gt;Pre-registration is now open at the meeting website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Guest Investigator Program Cycle 2 results available</title><link href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/guest-investigator-program-cycle-2-results-available.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-06-21T10:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-06-21T10:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Knicole Colon</name></author><id>tag:heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov,2019-06-21:/docs/tess/guest-investigator-program-cycle-2-results-available.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The selection of TESS Guest Investigator Program Cycle 2 proposals has been finalized.

TESS is currently collecting 2-minute cadence and 30-minute cadence full frame image science data from Observation Sector 5 in the Southern ecliptic hemisphere. Data from the first four Observation Sectors have been received on the ground and have been or are being processed through the pipeline. The TESS Science Office has been vetting planet candidates, and has begun issuing public Alerts on a select set of especially promising TESS candidates, that are also being followed up with ground-based telescopes to confirm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is anticipated that the full data set from Observation Sectors 1 and 2 will be released publicly via the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) in early December 2018. This release will be accompanied by a draft version of the instrument handbook and release notes for each sector. The TESS Data Release Notes will include data quality diagnostics and information about data and instrument characteristics. The full data set from Sectors 3 and 4 will be released no later than January 25, 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several services will be available to support the community with this early release of data. A summary of those services that will be available at the MAST for TESS data download of the first two TESS Sectors &lt;a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/tess/summary.html"&gt;is available&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, the MAST will provide an archive manual that will describe an overview of the TESS data products as well as instructions on how to download them.  The manual contains tutorials and python notebooks that walk through how to use the MAST Portal, exo.MAST and Astroquery to retrieve data for scientifically interesting use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/"&gt;TESS Science Support Center&lt;/a&gt; maintains a list of approved &lt;a href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/approved-programs.html"&gt;Guest Investigator (GI) programs&lt;/a&gt; and their associated targets that are or will be observed at 2-minute cadence in Cycle 1. The observed GI targets lists are also available for individual sectors. The TESS Science Support Center will provide links to additional tools and tutorials that can be used for analysis of TESS 2-minute cadence Target Pixel Files and 30-minute cadence Full Frame Images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deadline to submit proposals for TESS GI Cycle 2 is February 28, 2019. Cycle 2 covers targets in the Northern ecliptic hemisphere. Further information about the proposal process, proposal tools, and permitted science areas can be found on the TESS Science Support Center website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://tess.mit.edu/"&gt;TESS website at MIT&lt;/a&gt; contains information regarding the current schedule of observations.

The TESS data are being passed through the mission data pipeline at NASA’s Ames Research Center, referred to as the Science Processing Operations Center (SPOC). The science team has begun sifting through the data, searching for signals that look like promising candidate planets, that they plan to follow up using ground-based and space-based telescopes to confirm. The team began beta-testing the process by which the community is notified of these promising TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs) on September 5th. Announcements of compelling planet candidates have been submitted to preprint servers and await peer review and acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a careful quality check and review of the results by the TESS team, the data for the majority of the Alerts from Sector 1 were deemed ready to share with the broader scientific community. &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/tess-data-alerts/"&gt;MAST are hosting the SPOC Target Pixel Files, as well as the light curves and DV reports for those Alerts&lt;/a&gt; for which two-minute cadence data were collected. These data are being made available ahead of the full TESS first data release, and should still be considered preliminary. Short release notes are also available at MAST.

TESS is now pointed at the sky location for the second observation sector of the science survey, and will make a close approach to the Earth and download the first half of data from sector 2 this week. Meanwhile, the Sector 1 data are being passed through data analysis pipelines and the science team has begun sifting through the data, searching for signals that look like promising candidate planets. The TESS team has reported that the mission data have revealed dozens of exciting candidates that they plan to follow up using powerful ground-based telescopes to confirm. The team has begun beta-testing the process by which the community will be notified of these promising "TESS Object of Interest" (TOIs), with the goal of issuing fully public TOI Alerts in the next few months. The selected beta testers include professional and amateur astronomers who will contribute to the TESS exoplanet follow-up process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every new mission goes through a period of data validation and verification before beginning delivery of the final data to a public archive. This serves to test how the pipelines are performing on actual flight data from the mission, and determines whether any changes need to be made before the data are fully prepared for delivery to the archive. In the case of the TESS mission, once the data are delivered to the Mikulski Archive at Space Telescope (MAST) in Baltimore, they will be immediately available to anyone. The first delivery of TESS data to MAST is expected to occur no later than six months from the start of science observations, and will include all data from the first 4 27-day observations sectors. TOI Alerts will allow the broader astrophysics community, and the general public, to follow along with TESS’s most exciting discoveries, even before the first data are available in the MAST archive.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Sector 2 GI target list available</title><link href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/sector-2-gi-target-list-available.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-08-27T08:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-08-27T08:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Tom Barclay</name></author><id>tag:heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov,2018-08-27:/docs/tess/sector-2-gi-target-list-available.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;TESS Sector 2 began last week.

&lt;p&gt;While in the final science orbit, TESS, like anybody in a three-body system with little station keeping, goes through &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kozai_mechanism"&gt;Kozai cycles&lt;/a&gt;. TESS will primarily undergo tho periodic oscillations, one on a 10 month cycle, and another with a 10 year cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what does this mean? Well, the orbital period is not constant, neither is the inclination, eccentricity or any of the other orbital parameters. The orbital period ranges from about 12.8 to 14.6 days, with an average of 13.65 days. Furthermore, between now and 2020, the perigee distance will range from about 10 to 20 earth-radii.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure below nicely illustrates Kozai cycles influencing the argument of perigee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TESS will launch aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on Monday April 16 at 6:32 pm from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Airforce Station! The TESS spacecraft has been fueled and encapsulated in the rocket fairing and the Falcon 9 that will carry TESS to orbit has undergone a successful static fire. The fairing with TESS inside has been moved to the hangar at pad 40 to be mounted to the rocket. The team has passed the Launch Readiness Review and the are go for launch. In just hours away TESS will begin a 2 year mission to find planets orbiting the closest and brightest stars!&lt;/p&gt;

There you will find information on the data products, how the data products were created, and how to access the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simulated data, called ETE-6 (End-To-End 6) was created by TESS team members from NASA Ames and MIT to test the TESS ground system. This synthetic data contains 1 sector (slightly longer than two orbits) of TESS data and is meant to reflect what the archival data products will look like when produced for actual flight data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ETE-6 includes samples of the following data products:
Uncalibrated FFI's
Calibrated FFI's 
Extracted Light Curves (The simulated 2-min cadence data consist of 20,610 cadences)
Target Pixel Files
Data Validation Files 
Cotrending Basis Vectors 
Collateral Target Pixel Files
Models (Huffman tables, Mean Black table, flat-field, read-noise, linearity, gain, etc.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data inlude injected signals to mimic transiting planets, eclipsing binaries, and stellar variability in 15,000 target stars selected for 2-minute cadence observations. Note these injected signals were designed to test the sensitivity of the NASA Ames planet search pipeline and does not represent what is expected in the actual data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/tess/ete-6/ETE-6_README.pdf"&gt;README&lt;/a&gt; file is available at MAST and contains information on how these products were created and their caveats. More detailed information on the data products can be found in the &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/tess/doc/EXP-TESS-ARC-ICD-TM-0014.pdf"&gt;TESS Science Data Products Description&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These data will allow the astronomical community to develop software and tools, and follow-up observation strategies, in anticipation for actual data, which is expected to be delivered to the MAST within 6 months of the start of science operations.&lt;/p&gt;

Grants will be released when data is publicly available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The over-subscription factor for this program was extremely high (4.5). Many highly rated programs were not able to be selected for funding. However, we have good news. All full-frame-image data will be released publicly with no exclusive use period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we anticipate that the number of executed 2-minute cadence target programs will significantly exceed the number that we were able to fund. Therefore, even though a particular program may not have been selected for funding there is still a good chance that it will be either partially for full executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We anticipate that target lists for the first sector to be available within a few weeks of launch.

&lt;p&gt;TESS Guest Investigator Cycle 1 is awarding targets in the Southern Ecliptic Hemisphere. Northern Ecliptic targets will be solicited in Cycle 2. Including targets that can't be observed won't technically impact your proposal - we will just remove them - but it may suggest to reviewers that you haven't done your homework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your target lists should be in priority order. We many choose to award less than the full proposed target list; providing your targets in ranked order enables us to do this. For proposals with very large target lists, we recommend mentioning in the proposal the minimum number of target required to accomplish the scientific goals.&lt;/p&gt;

As a result of these discussions the mission is committing to observing at two-minute cadence all stars that fall into the TESS field of view that are (a) brighter than 6th magnitude in the TESS bandpass, and (b) but are not too bright that their saturation bleed cannot be captured fully with a pixel mask. For Cycle-1 this accounts for approximately 6,000 stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have made a slight modification to the &lt;a href="data/core-science-targets-v2.csv"&gt;list of targets&lt;/a&gt; that should not be included in TESS Cycle 1 GI proposals to search for transiting exoplanets using two-minute cadence data. This list now includes these 6,000 bright stars. This change is unlikely to significantly impact any proposals because these the majority of these bright stars are large (M-giants, B-stars, etc.). This makes detecting transiting planets challenging, and the detectability is unlikely to be improved with two-minute cadence over the full-frame image data.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>TESS-HERMES catalog of spectroscopic stellar parameters is now available</title><link href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/tess-hermes-catalog-of-spectroscopic-stellar-parameters-is-now-available.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-08-24T13:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-08-24T13:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Elisa Quintana</name></author><id>tag:heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov,2017-08-24:/docs/tess/tess-hermes-catalog-of-spectroscopic-stellar-parameters-is-now-available.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A catalog of spectroscopic stellar parameters for stars in the TESS southern continuous viewing zone (CVZ) is now available and may prove a useful resource for &lt;a href="proposing-investigations.html"&gt;TESS GI proposal preparation&lt;/a&gt;.

Stellar surface gravity and radius are made available for an additional set of roughly 8,500 red giants.

&lt;p&gt;Now that TESS has completed this critical review, the mission's cameras and science data processing computer are scheduled to begin installation onto the spacecraft at Orbital ATK in Dulles, Virginia, over the next several weeks. Once successfully integrated, the spacecraft will spend the rest of the year undergoing rigorous testing to ensure the mission can withstand the harsh environment of space. The spacecraft is scheduled to ship in February to NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida for launch aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the Kepler telescope, by design there is a range of focus and image quality across the TESS camera's field of view. Recent measurements revealed the TESS cameras to have slightly reduced focus and image quality near the outer edge of the image when placed in the cold temperatures of space, and better camera focus and image quality towards the center of the image. The difference between the designed and measured focus and image quality will not affect the mission's science goals.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Error in a small number of TIC v5 surface gravities</title><link href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/error-in-a-small-number-of-tic-v5-surface-gravities.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-08-01T14:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-08-01T14:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Tom Barclay</name></author><id>tag:heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov,2017-08-01:/docs/tess/error-in-a-small-number-of-tic-v5-surface-gravities.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The surface gravities reported in column 67 of the TESS Input Catalog version 5 (TIC-5), do not accurately represent the expected surface gravities using the reported values for mass (column 73) and radii (column 71).

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, for TIC v5, numerical columns with values of exactly 0 are actually null values. Starting in TIC v6, these will be properly set to null, but due to a translation error they have been assigned values of exactly 0 in TIC v5 at MAST.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up to date TIC information is available from the &lt;a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/tess/tic_doc.html"&gt;MAST TIC documentation page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>ExoFOP-TESS now online</title><link href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/exofop-tess-now-online.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-08-01T10:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-08-01T10:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Elisa Quintana</name></author><id>tag:heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov,2017-08-01:/docs/tess/exofop-tess-now-online.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://exofop.ipac.caltech.edu/tess/"&gt;ExoFOP-TESS&lt;/a&gt; is a web-based service developed and operated by the &lt;a href="http://nexsci.caltech.edu"&gt;NASA Exoplanet Science Institute&lt;/a&gt; (NExScI) and the &lt;a href="https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu"&gt;NASA Exoplanet Archive&lt;/a&gt; to optimize resources and facilitate collaboration in follow-up studies of targets observed by TESS. &lt;a href="https://exofop.ipac.caltech.edu"&gt;ExoFOP&lt;/a&gt; serves as a repository for community-gathered follow-up data by allowing upload and display of data …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://exofop.ipac.caltech.edu/tess/"&gt;ExoFOP-TESS&lt;/a&gt; is a web-based service developed and operated by the &lt;a href="http://nexsci.caltech.edu"&gt;NASA Exoplanet Science Institute&lt;/a&gt; (NExScI) and the &lt;a href="https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu"&gt;NASA Exoplanet Archive&lt;/a&gt; to optimize resources and facilitate collaboration in follow-up studies of targets observed by TESS. &lt;a href="https://exofop.ipac.caltech.edu"&gt;ExoFOP&lt;/a&gt; serves as a repository for community-gathered follow-up data by allowing upload and display of data and derived astrophysical parameters, and has been widely used by the Kepler and K2 Follow-Up Observation Programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the initial release of &lt;a href="https://exofop.ipac.caltech.edu/tess/"&gt;ExoFOP-TESS&lt;/a&gt;, overview pages for each of the 10.8 million stars in the &lt;a href="proposing-investigations.html#candidate-target-list-ctl"&gt;TESS Candidate Target list (CTL)&lt;/a&gt; have been created. These pages contain data from the TESS Input Catalog (TIC) Version 5, including coordinates, magnitudes, stellar parameters, and planet parameters (if available). The pages also contain external links to other archives, and all content can be viewed without logging in. The ability to upload data and parameters and to search the CTL targets will be coming soon. &lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;a href="proposing-investigations.html"&gt;TESS Guest Investigator (GI) Program&lt;/a&gt; solicits proposals for the acquisition and analysis of scientific data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission, a NASA Explorer mission currently scheduled for launch no later than June 2018. In a 2-year, near all-sky survey, TESS will monitor the brightness of nearby, bright F, G, K, and M stars in order to photometrically search for transiting planets smaller than Neptune. TESS will monitor the brightness of more than 200,000 stars spread over the celestial sphere with a photometric sensitivity sufficient to permit detection of transiting planets with radii less than 2.5 Earth radii. The mission’s high-precision, continuous baseline photometric capability is also well suited for variability and asteroseismology research and analyses of both Galactic and extragalactic astrophysical sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observations associated with the TESS Guest Investigator (GI) Cycle 1 solicitation will begin immediately following the successful ~60-day scientific commissioning of the spacecraft. Proposals submitted to this program should be for new science investigations of the southern ecliptic hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase-1 proposals are due by 4:30 pm Eastern time on September 29, 2017&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>TESS Science Support Center at KepSciCon</title><link href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/tess-science-support-center-at-kepscicon.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-06-16T10:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-06-16T10:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Tom Barclay</name></author><id>tag:heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov,2017-06-16:/docs/tess/tess-science-support-center-at-kepscicon.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We will be hosting a breakout session at the Kepler Science Conference, at NASA Ames, CA.

Our first cycle deadline will be on September 29, 2017, with the in-person peer review likely taking place in mid-December. We are currently looking for volunteers with expertise in astrophysics and exoplanet science to serve on our review panel. The requirements are that you have a PhD or relevant experience (so this opportunity isn't open to graduate students), and that you are not intending to PI a TESS Cycle 1 proposal (it's fine if you later choose to submit a proposal, but we would then not invite you to the review). &lt;/p&gt;
