&lt;p&gt;This week, we are looking at three recent papers from the archive. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21743"&gt;The frequency of transiting planetary systems around polluted white dwarfs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Robert et al. 2024)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About one in four white dwarfs exhibit dust and gas emission, metals in the photosphere, and even transit events, suggesting the presence of planetary systems. These signatures offer a rare glimpse into the formation and architecture of said systems, and their corresponding evolution as their host stars evolve into white dwarfs. Robert et al. (2024) present a detailed investigation aimed at constraining the frequency of planetary systems around polluted white dwarfs based on established transit-searching methods. The authors utilized high-cadence photometry from ULTRACAM, ULTRASPEC, and TESS of 313 metal-polluted white dwarfs to identify potential transiting exoplanets or debris. TESS observed the targets at 2-min and 20-sec cadence (214 targets for the latter), with a median observing coverage of 2.3 sectors per target. Robert et al. (2024) used the BLS and Lomb-Scargle algorithms to search for transit-like signals, and performed injection-and-retrieval analysis to evaluate the corresponding detection efficiency. The authors recovered two of the three systems known to exhibit irregular transit events, ZTF J0328–1219 and WD 1054–226, as well as two known ZZ Ceti pulsators (G29-38 and KX Dra), and rule out single-transit candidates. Robert et al. (2024) note that their search did not yield new candidates and suggest that the non-detection of the third known transiting system, WD 1145+017, is potentially due to changes in the corresponding circumstellar activity. Based on their findings, the authors estimate that the transit fraction for polluted white dwarfs is about 1%, indicating that while metal pollution is common among these stars, the corresponding frequency of short-period, transiting planetary systems around is rather low. Capitalizing on data from TESS, the authors were able to suggest that such planets are likely engulfed during the red giant phase of stellar evolution, leaving them little chance to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18851"&gt;The accreted Galaxy: An overview of TESS metal-poor accreted stars candidates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(de Brito Silva et al. 2024)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formation history of the Milky Way is an active field of research, with multiple findings suggesting an extragalactic origin for a number of stars through multiple accretion and/or merger events. Distinguishing between the various potential progenitors of these events generally involves multiple observational constraints, including chemical compositions, ages, and dynamical properties. de Brito Silva et al. (2024) present a comprehensive study of the merger history of the Milky Way based on observations of 30 metal-poor accreted star candidates obtained from TESS, Gaia, and the MIKE spectrograph on the 6.5-m Clay telescope. TESS observed the targets in the Southern Continuous Viewing Zone and previous work based on asteroseismological analysis provided the ages for 2 stars, as well as the frequency of maximum power and the large frequency separation for 21 stars. de Brito Silva et al. (2024) calculated the effective temperatures, surface gravities, and velocities of the targets, and estimated the corresponding total energy (E), eccentricity and angular momentum along the z-direction (Lz). The surface gravities, in particular, were estimated by three different methods – asteroseismic, spectroscopic, and predicted. To determine the respective stellar ages, the authors utilized the asteroseismic measurements of the frequency of maximum power and large frequency separation, and the corresponding three estimates of the surface gravities. de Brito Silva et al. (2024) found that the orbital eccentricities for 28 of the 30 targets exceed 0.7, supporting the accretion hypothesis, note that the majority of their targets occupy a E-Lz parameter space occupied by Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus stars, and identify two stars as potential members of the Sequoia system. Utilizing TESS data, the authors were able to obtain valuable new insight into the formation history of the Milky Way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18199"&gt;GJ 238 b: A 0.57 Earth Radius Planet Orbiting an M2.5 Dwarf Star at 15.2 pc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Tey et al. 2024)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relatively small size and mass of terrestrial exoplanets make it quite difficult to find them either in transit across their host star, or through radial velocity measurements. Yet these are particularly interesting targets both for comparative studies with the terrestrial planets in the Solar System and, more broadly, in the search for life outside the Earth. Tey et al. (2024) present the discovery and validation of the smallest transiting planet detected by TESS to date, GJ 238 b. The target is close to the Southern Ecliptic pole and was observed by TESS in 25 cycles during Cycles 1 and 3 in short cadence. The target star, GJ 238, is an M dwarf with a spectral class of M2.5 at a distance of 15.2 pc, and has a relatively high proper motion (~900 mas/year). GJ 283 has a mass of 0.42 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, radius of 0.43 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, effective temperature of 3485 K, and [Fe/H] of 0.15. To estimate the orbital and physical properties of the system, the authors combined TESS data with archival and follow-up observations from UKST, Las Cumbres Observatory, WASP, ESO 3.6-m/HARPS, and SOAR/HSCam. Additionally, Tey et al. (2024) ruled out common sources of false positives, validated the planet candidate statistically, confirmed that the transit-like events originate from the target star, and that the transiting object is both smaller and less massive than a giant planet. The planet, GJ 238 b, has an orbital period of 1.74 days, radius of 0.57 R&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;, and estimated equilibrium temperature of 758 K. Thanks to TESS, Tey et al. (2024) were able to discover and validate the smallest transiting exoplanet detected by the mission to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, we are looking at three recent papers from the archive. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07607"&gt;Searching for stellar cycles on low mass stars using TESS data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Ramsay et al. 2024)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low mass stars represent the majority of the stellar population in the Galaxy. Thus, they are important both in terms of stellar astrophysics and of the search for exoplanets. Many of these stars are active, some are fully convective, and their relatively small size makes it easier to detect transiting planets. Ramsay et al. (2024) present a pilot study of the dominant periods in TESS lightcurves of low mass stars, and a search for long-term stellar activity cycles. The authors examined a sample of 1950 M dwarfs (stellar type later than M0V) on or near the main sequence, residing in the north and south continuous viewing zone of TESS, and located within 100 pc from the Sun. For comparison, Ramsay et al. (2024) also studied a sample of 1432 Sun-like stars (stellar type F5V to K2V) fulfilling the same constraints. The targets were observed by TESS in full-frame image cadence in Sectors 1-61, and the authors required that each star is observed in at least 6 Sectors. Utilizing the TESS-SPOC data, Ramsay et al. (2024) performed a Generalized Lomb Scargle Periodogram analysis to search for evidence of periodic lightcurve variability and, if present, for variations in the corresponding amplitude. The authors found that 245 of the 1950 M dwarfs (~12.6%) exhibit strong evidence of stable photometric variability, which they attribute to stellar rotation. The variability fraction among the sample of 1432 Sun-like stars is comparable, i.e. 194 of the 1432 targets (~13.5%) show clear lightcurve modulations. In contrast, Ramsay et al. (2024) found that many more low mass stars produce stable long-term variability compared to Sun-like stars for periods shorter than about 4 days. Additionally, the authors detected evidence of variability of the photometric amplitude in 26 of the 245 variable M dwarfs, where some show a monotonic trend over the course of 3-4 years or even longer, while others exhibit variations on much shorter timescales. Of the 194 variable Sun-like stars, only one exhibits evidence for significant changes in the corresponding photometric amplitude. Thanks to TESS data, Ramsay et al. (2024) were able to notably expand the number of low mass stars exhibiting rapid rotation and potential activity cycles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08305"&gt;TESS observations of non-Be fast rotators&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Naze et al. 2024)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-Be stars are a class of fast-rotating OB stars without known discretion disks. Their counterparts, Oe/Be stars, are likewise rapid rotators that occasionally produce Balmer emission lines. Comparing these two stellar populations sheds light on the importance of disks to the observed variability, and on the physics of stellar rotation. Naze et al. (2024) present a detailed study of fast rotating (Vsini &amp;gt; 200 km/sec) early B-type stars (B0V to B3V) without known disks, utilizing data from Kepler and TESS. The authors investigated the lightcurves of 58 relatively isolated stars, i.e. no known close companions and no bright neighbors within 1 arcmin, with effective temperatures between 17,000 K and 31,500 K, and log(g) &amp;gt; 3.7. TESS observed 56 of the 58  targets, all but one in multiple sectors, in short- and long-cadence; the remaining two targets were observed by Kepler. The authors performed frequency spectra analysis to evaluate the noise properties of the available photometry and search for genuine astrophysical signals. Naze et al. (2024) detected red and white noise throughout the target sample, and found no correlations between various red noise parameters or between these and the corresponding stellar properties. The authors found that long-term variability is not only present in about 20-30% of the target sample, but also dominates the frequency spectra of about one in ten targets, and argue that the occurrence of said variability is notably lower compared to that of Be stars. In contrast,  Naze et al. (2024) detected strong frequency groups in about 30% of the target sample, comparable to that of Be stars. The authors note that isolated frequencies in the range of 0.5-6/day are present in about two thirds of the target sample, and dominate the frequency spectrum for 41% of the examined stars, i.e. higher rates compared to Be stars. Similarly, Naze et al. (2024) found that higher frequency signals of up to 40/day are more prevalent in non-Be stars than in Be stars, noting that these signals are rarely dominant. Capitalizing on TESS data, Naze et al. (2024) were able to compare the frequency spectra of a large number of non-Be stars to those of Be stars and find a number of differences and similarities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07187"&gt;TOI 762 A b and TIC 46432937 b: Two Giant Planets Transiting M Dwarf Stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Hartman et al. 2024)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large planets around small stars are important tracers of planet formation and evolution. Of the 20 confirmed transiting giant planets orbiting M dwarfs, 17 have either been detected thanks to TESS, or data from the mission had a major contribution to the discovery. Hartman et al. (2024) present the confirmation of two new short-period, transiting gas giants, TOI 762 A b and TIC 46432937 b, with M dwarf host stars. TESS observed TOI 762 A b at 2-min cadence in Sectors 10, 36, 37, and 63, and TIC 46432937 b at 30-min cadence in Sector 6 and at 10-min cadence in Sector 32. Both planets were initially detected as high-confidence candidates in TESS Cycle 1 observations by several independent efforts, and their transits were successfully recovered in subsequent sectors. To complement the TESS data, the authors obtained photometric and spectroscopic follow-up observations from Gemini-South, LCOGT, La Silla/ExTrA, Trappist, Speculoos, and VLT/Espresso. To derive the physical and orbital parameters of the two systems, Hartman et al. (2024) performed a comprehensive joint stellar and planetary modeling, utilizing Gaia data as well. The authors found that TOI 762 A b has a mass of 0.25 M&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;, radius of 0.74 R&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;, orbital period of 3.47 days, and equilibrium temperature of 555 K. The host star is an M dwarf with mass of 0.44 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, radius 0.43 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, effective temperature 3267 K, and age of 9.3 Gyr. The system is a wide binary, with a resolved secondary component with a mass of about 0.23 MSun and at a projected separation of about 320 AU. TIC 46432937 b is an order of magnitude more massive than TOI 762 A b , with Mp = 3.2 M&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;, and nearly twice as large (R&lt;sub&gt;planet&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.2 R&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;). The orbital period of TIC 46432937 b is 1.44 days and the planet has an equilibrium temperature of 872 K. The host star has a mass of 0.56 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, radius of 0.53 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, effective temperature of 3572 K, and age of 7.4 Gyr. TESS data enabled the discovery and confirmation of two new giant planets in short orbits around M dwarfs, TOI 762 A b and TIC 46432937 b.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06688"&gt;9 new M Dwarf Planet Candidates from TESS Including 5 Gas Giants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Eschen &amp;amp; Kunimoto 2024)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relatively small size of M dwarfs makes them well-suited targets for the detection of transiting planets. Combined with their comparatively lower luminosity, these stars provide an excellent opportunity to detect short-period planets in the habitable zone. Eschen &amp;amp; Kunimoto (2024) capitalize on the Full-Frame Image data from TESS to pursue a new search for transiting planets around M-dwarfs. The authors utilized the QLP photometry from Sectors 1-63 and the BLS algorithm to search for transits in the lightcurves of 107,303 M-dwarfs brighter than T = 13.5 mag. Eschen &amp;amp; Kunimoto (2024) detrend the data with the wotan code, using a detrending width to 0.75 days, set the minimum period searched to 0.5 days and the maximum period searched to either half the longest available observed baseline or 100 days, and require the detection of at least 3 transits. To vet and validate the potential signals, the authors use established procedures that include tests for e.g. eclipsing binary stars, stellar variability, systematic effects, transit asymmetry, unphysical orbital configurations, false positive probability, manual triage. Eschen &amp;amp; Kunimoto (2024) note that the vast majority of the 13,642 detected transit-like signals were ruled as false positives. From the remaining signals, the authors recovered 85 known TESS Objects of Interest and found 9 new planet candidates. The latter have orbital periods in the range of 0.6-20 days, and sizes in the range of 2-11 Earth radii. Five of the new candidates are likely gas giants, one of which has a significant orbital eccentricity (~0.47) that hints at potential high-eccentricity orbital migration origin. Thanks to TESS, Eschen &amp;amp; Kunimoto (2024) were able to find new 9 planet candidates around M-dwarfs, including 5 short-period potential gas giants that represent a relatively rare type of planets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09220"&gt;An improved asteroseismic age of the rapid rotator Altair from TESS data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Rieutord et al. 2024)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a visual magnitude of about 0.8 mag, Altair is one of the brightest stars in the sky and, at a distance of about 5 pc, also one of the nearest. It is an A-type main-sequence star exhibiting delta Scuti oscillations, has an obliquity of about 50 degrees and a true equatorial velocity that is nearly 75% of the estimated breakup velocity (~300 km/sec vs 400 km/sec). Rieutord et al. (2024) present a new astreroseismic analysis of Altair aimed at better understanding the detailed characteristics of the star. TESS observed the target in Sector 54 at 2-min cadence. With a TESS magnitude of T = 0.58 mag, Altair poses a significant saturation challenge when analyzing the data – the light from the star spills over hundreds of pixels. The authors overcome this challenge with the established technique of halo photometry, which enables the recovery of saturated light from nearby pixels minimizing the corresponding flux variations. Rieutord et al. (2024) performed a Lomb-Scargle analysis of the extracted photometry, derived the corresponding power spectrum, and detected 34 distinct frequencies. Twenty two of these are new detections while the remaining twelve are known from previous work. Based on model predictions, the authors associate three of the known frequencies (23.2791, 25.95061, 28.4064 cycles/day) and seven of the new detections with the ten axisymmetric modes. Rieutord et al. (2024) combine three of these ten frequencies with previous estimates of Altair’s mass to determine its radius and age. The authors find that the hydrogen mass fraction in the core is X&lt;sub&gt;core&lt;/sub&gt; /X&lt;sub&gt;ini&lt;/sub&gt; ~ 0.97, with X&lt;sub&gt;ini&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.74 and, using a 1-D MESA and 2-D ESTER models, estimate an age of 88+/-10 Myrs. Capitalizing on TESS observations of the bright star Altair, Rieutord et al. (2024) were able to obtain new asteroseismological constraints on the stellar parameters, and argue that still more observations are needed to understand the origin of the highest amplitude oscillations detected in the lightcurve at 15.76789 cycles/day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12578"&gt;Periodic variable A-F spectral type stars in the southern TESS continuous viewing zone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Skarka &amp;amp; Henzl 2024)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stellar variability is a complex phenomenon that covers a wide range of stellar types, amplitudes, modes and timescales, classification types, etc. Understanding the various effects and underlying causes is further complicated when multiple mechanisms are operating simultaneously, such as in A-F type stars. Skarka &amp;amp; Henzl (2024) present a study of variable A-F stars in the southern continuous viewing zone of TESS. The authors investigate a sample of 2302 stars that are listed in the Simbad database, have effective temperatures between 6,000 and 10,000 K, and are brighter than V = 10 mag. TESS observed the targets in Sectors 1-13 and 27-39, and the authors used the corresponding SPOC (short- and long-cadence) and QLP (long-cadence) lightcurves, the latter only when the former is not available. To classify the targets, Skarka &amp;amp; Henzl (2024) analyzed the corresponding frequency spectra and utilized an established scheme based on three general categories of stellar variables – eclipsing binaries, rotators, pulsators, each including several subcategories. The authors identified a total of 1171 variable stars (51% of their target sample) and manually classified ~67% of these as one of several pre-defined categories including  delta Sct and gamma Dor pulsators and hybrid pulsators, rotational variables, eclipsing binaries, etc. Skarka &amp;amp; Henzl (2024) were unable to determine the variability type for 372 targets, and ruled out dozens of false positives caused by contamination from nearby variable stars. The authors classified ~43% of all variable stars (503 out of 1171) as pulsators, noting that the fraction is ~22% lower than that obtained from a similar sample in the northern continuous viewing zone of TESS. The authors also confirmed previous findings highlighting that variability classification is a complex process that requires comprehensive consideration, and found large discrepancies in the classifications provided by catalogs of variable stars. Finally, Skarka &amp;amp; Henzl (2024) argue that the variable star classification enabled by TESS is superior to that of other photometric surveys. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, we are looking at three recent papers from the archive. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08607"&gt;The evolution of stellar X-ray activity and angular momentum as seen by eROSITA, TESS, and Gaia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Stassun &amp;amp; Kounkel 2024)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X-ray activity and stellar rotation are critical calibrators for constraining stellar ages. Young stars typically exhibit strong X-ray activity and short rotation periods that evolve with time such that the former decreases in strength as the stars spin down. Stassun &amp;amp; Kounkel (2024) present a detailed analysis of a large sample of F5V-M5V stars with known X-ray activity, rotation periods, and ages, utilizing data from eROSITA, TESS, and Gaia. The authors investigated 8,267 stars with effective temperatures between 3,000 and 6,700 K, detected periodic variations in TESS Full-Frame Image lightcurves in the range of 0.1-20 days, X-ray luminosities between 10&lt;sup&gt;27.8&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;31.5&lt;/sup&gt; erg/sec, ages between 3 and 500 Myr, and distances of up to 3 kpc. Additionally, the authors estimate the corresponding stellar radii and masses, and derive the respective angular momentum assuming simple solid body rotation. Stassun &amp;amp; Kounkel (2024) argue that the correlation between the rotation period, the X-ray luminosity, and the stellar color of the target sample show the expected “horseshoe shape”, with the older stars being typically slower rotators and vice versa, and note that at a given effective temperature, the younger the star is the stronger the X-ray luminosity (see Fig. 1). Unexpectedly, the authors find that the correlation between the X-ray luminosity and the angular momentum is simpler than the correlation between the X-ray luminosity and the rotation period. Thanks to data from TESS, Stassun &amp;amp; Kounkel (2024) were able to empirically constrain the rotationally-driven X-ray activity for the largest to date sample of F5V-M5V stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17155"&gt;A low-mass sub-Neptune planet transiting the bright active star HD 73344&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Sulis et al. 2024)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sub-Neptunes are planets with radii between 2 and 4 R&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;, residing in the transition regime between rocky planets and gas giants. Interestingly, there are no such planets in the Solar System even though they represent a large fraction of the overall planet population. Sulis et al. (2024) present the discovery and characterization of HD 73344 b -- the latest addition to the family of sub-Neptunes -- based on data from TESS, K2, OHP, Keck, and Spitzer. The planet was initially detected as a candidate in K2 data, where it produced six transits. TESS observed HD 73344 at 2-min cadence in Sectors 45 and 46, where the planet produced three transits (see Fig. 2); Spitzer observed one transit in 2019 August 9th. The authors obtained precise radial velocities from SOPHIE and HIRES, found that the dominant RV variability is due to stellar activity, and noted that the rotation period is close to the orbital period of the transiting planet. To determine the physical and orbital parameters of the system, Sulis et al. (2024) incorporated all the available data into the PASTIS software. The authors determined that the host star has a mass M&lt;sub&gt;star&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.2 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, radius R&lt;sub&gt;star&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.2 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, effective temperature T&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; = 6220 K, metallicity [Fe/H] = 0.18, and rotation period of 9.1 days. The planet has a mass M&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.9 R&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;, mass M&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = 3 M&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;, and orbital period of 15.6 days. Sulis et al. (2024) also argue that there is an additional periodic signal present in the radial velocity data suggesting the presence of a second, non-transiting planet with M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;sini = 116 M&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt; and P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 66.45 days. The high-precision photometry from TESS helped confirm the sub-Neptune HD 73344 b, first detected by K2 and a potential target for atmospheric characterization with JWST and/or ARIEL. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15021"&gt;Confirmation and Characterization of the Eccentric, Warm Jupiter TIC 393818343 b with a Network of Citizen Scientists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Sgro et al. 2024)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warm Jupiters are giant planets with masses greater than 0.25 M&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt; and orbital periods in the range of 10-100+ days, corresponding to semi-major axes of ~0.1-0.5 AU. These planets inform our understanding of the formation and evolution of hot Jupiters (P &amp;lt; 10 days), and are also linked to the population of long-period Jovian planets. At the time of writing, there are 27 confirmed warm Jupiters, all discovered from TESS. Due to the relatively long orbital period of warm Jupiters, compared to the duration of a single TESS sector, there are many single-transit candidates. Sgro et al. (2024) present the confirmation and characterization of  the warm Jupiter candidate TIC 393818343 b, utilizing TESS data, spectroscopic observations, and photometric follow-up from citizen scientists with the Unistellar Network and Exoplanet Watch projects. TESS observed the target at 2-min cadence in Sector 55 and detected a single transit on 2022 August 19th, consistent with a long-period giant planet. The authors combined the TESS data with radial velocity measurements from Keck and Lick observatories to predict future transit windows, and initiated a follow-up photometric campaign performed by citizen scientists. The campaign resulted in the detection of two partial transits, one on 2023 May 23rd and another on 2023 June 24th (see Fig. 3). Combining all available data, the authors modeled the system with EXOFASTv2 and obtained an orbital period P = 16.25 days, eccentricity e = 0.61, planet mass M = 4.3 M&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;, and planet radius R = 1.1 R&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;. Thanks to TESS, Sgro et al. (2024) were able to confirm and characterize the most eccentric warm Jupiter discovered from the mission – TIC 393818343 b. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;T Coronae Borealis (T CrB for short) is a recurrent novae (RNe) located 3,000 light years away in the constellation of Corona Borealis. It is one of only a few known RNe in our galaxy and has a recurrence period of 80 years, with its last eruption observed in 1946.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all novae, T CrB is a binary system consisting of a White Dwarf (WD, ~1.2 - 1.37 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;) pulling hydrogen rich material from the surface of a secondary star via an accretion disc. The secondary star in this case is red giant which dominates the optical and infrared light of the system. The nova outburst observed is caused by a thermonuclear runaway in the collected material on the surface of the WD, and in the case of T CrB the outburst is spectacular!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In previous outburst events the T CrB was seen to increase from a quiescence magnitude of ~10 mags in V, to a shocking naked eye brightness of 2 mags - this is comparable to Polaris!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T CrB is also interesting in that it has a pre-outburst tell, alerting the community that it will soon go nova. This tell comes in the form of a dip in the light curve about a year before eruption. This dip was observed by Louisiana State scientists in March/April of last year, meaning that T CrB should go nova any day now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the event happens between April 23rd and May 21st it will also be observed serendipitously by TESS in Sector 78.
TESS has already observed the system in quiescence during Sectors 24, 25, and 51 (see Fig 1), but if the nova has an outburst in S78, TESS will obtain a wonderful light curve of its rise and decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, we are looking at three recent papers from the archive. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023PASP..135l4201A/abstract"&gt;The Abrupt Resumptions of Pulsations in α Cygni (Deneb)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Abt et al. 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deneb is an A2 Iae supergiant near the Cepheid strip, with a dominant period of 11.7 days and an apparent magnitude of 1.25. As one of the brightest stars in the night sky it has been extensively studied for more than a century, both spectroscopically and photometrically. During these observations, it has been discovered that after the large-amplitude pulsations damp down, a new set of pulsations start almost immediately, with a typical interval timescale of about 72 days. Abt et al. (2023) present a detailed analysis of the unusual behavior of Deneb utilizing TESS data, archival photometry, and spectroscopy. TESS observed the target in 2-min cadence in Sectors 41, 55, and 56, and the authors observed a prominent increase in the regularity and amplitude of the pulsations in all three sectors. Abt et al. (2023) also confirm that a prominent, nearly-regular 12-day pulsation period is present in the data, and note that the beginning of a new pulsation cycle is clearly detected in Sector 55. Additionally, the authors state that while these 3 sectors are insufficient to verify the unusual ~70-day cycle for the resumption of the pulsations and constrain its starting point, future TESS observations have the potential to do so. Combining the existing data with new observations from Sectors 76, 82, and 83, TESS offers the potential to unravel the mysteries of this most unusual star. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13638"&gt;Rapid Optical Flare in the Extreme TeV Blazar 1ES 0229+200 on Intraday Timescale with TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Kishore et al. 2024)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blazars are a class of active galactic nuclei exhibiting prominent stochastic light curve variability that reach large amplitudes and span short timescales. These can be used to constrain the physical parameters of the system, and provide deeper understanding of the underlying processes and mechanisms. Kishore et al. (2024) present a detailed analysis of 1ES 0229+200 – a high-redshift (z ~ 0.14), extreme TeV, high-frequency peaked BL Lac-type blazar. The target was observed by TESS in Sectors 42, 43, and 44, and the authors used both the 2-min and the 30-min cadence data to study the optical variability on intra-day timescales. The authors detected rapid, yet short-lived, variability in Sector 42 and found no indications of significant variations in the other two sectors. The Sector 42 light curve shows a prominent flaring event lasting for about 6 hours, with a symmetric profile and exhibiting identical e-folding timescales with an average of about 0.88 hours. Combining the latter with the measured redshift, Kishore et al. (2024) were able to place an upper limit on the corresponding physical size of the emission region of about 3.3x10^15 cm. In addition, the authors performed Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis of the Sector 42 data, and measured a power spectrum density slope of 4.3 for the flaring region (both in the 2-min and in the 30-min cadence data). Away from the flare, the measured slope is ~0.04/1.9 for the 2-min/30-min cadence, respectively. The authors attribute this difference to the different background subtraction between the two cadences. Kishore et al. (2024) note that the in-flare power spectrum density slope is unusually high, and argue that it indicates a sudden change in the electron distribution. Thanks to TESS data, the authors were able to obtain the first evidence for a prominent, rapid, short-lived optical flare in the lightcurve of the TeV blazar 1ES 0229+200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01092"&gt;Rediscussion of eclipsing binaries. Paper XVIII. The F-type system OO Pegasi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Southworth 2024)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detached eclipsing binary stars enable direct measurements of stellar masses and radii, which make them critical calibrators for the physical processes underlying the theoretical models for stellar formation and evolution. As such, benchmark systems that provide high-precision measurements are high-priority targets for detailed studies. Southworth (2024) combines TESS data with archival spectroscopic measurements and presents a comprehensive analysis of the eclipsing binary OO Pegasi. The system is relatively bright (V =84 mag) and consists of two late A-type stars (A7V + A8V) on a circular orbit with a period of 2.985 days. TESS observed OO Peg in 10-min cadence in Sector 55 (and will observe again in Sector 82) and clearly detected the primary and secondary eclipses. Southworth (2024) found no evidence for period changes with respect to the known ephemeris, decreased the period uncertainty by a factor of 3, and noted that there is ~1% contamination in the TESS light curve due to resolved nearby sources. The author performed light curve analysis by combining the TESS photometry with radial velocity measurements into the JKTEBOP code. Southworth (2024) found that the primary star is slightly less massive than the secondary (1.69 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt; vs 1.74 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;), slightly larger, hotter, and more luminous. The author measured corresponding mass uncertainties of 5.2% and 3.3%, respectively, radius uncertainties of about 1.4%, and noted that the measured radii of both stars disagree with previous results. The author also notes that while both stars reside in a parameter space where a large fraction of stars are delta Scuti pulsators, neither exhibits pulsations. Thanks to TESS, Southworth (2024) was able to obtain high-quality photometric parameters for the detached eclipsing binary OO Pegasi. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17272"&gt;Signs of magnetic star-planet interactions in HD 118203. TESS detects stellar variability that matches the orbital period of a close-in eccentric Jupiter-sized companion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Castro-Gonzales et al. 2024)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HD 118203 is a relatively bright (V = 8 mag), high proper-motion (~115 mas/yr), slightly evolved star hosting a Jupiter-sized planet with an orbital period of 6.135 days, semi-major axis of 0.086 AU, and eccentricity of about 0.3. As such, the system is well-suited for studies aimed at detecting magnetic interactions. Castro-Gonzales et al. (2024) present a detailed analysis of the system combining TESS data, ASAS-SN photometry, and spectroscopic measurements from ELODIE. TESS observed the target at 2-min cadence in Sectors 15, 16, 22, and 49, and detected the ~3.9 parts-per-thousand (ppt) transits of the planet in each sector as well as prominent out-of-transit variability with a standard deviation of about 0.46 ppt (see Fig. 1). The authors utilized a joint radial velocity and transit model to refine the parameters of the system, and search for potential signs of magnetic interactions between the host star and its planet. Castro-Gonzales et al. (2024) report evidence of stellar activity in TESS data with a periodicity of about 6.1 days – matching the orbital period – which they attribute to magnetic star-planet interactions. The authors note that the activity signal modulates on orbital timescales, exhibiting large variations in shape and amplitude, and is not present in the ASAS-SN and ELODIE data. Additionally, Castro-Gonzales et al. (2024) suggest that the rotation of the planet is expected to be pseudo-synchronous with its orbital period with a periodicity of about 3.73 days, and argue that the high orbital eccentricity of the planet is likely a critical factor for the generation of the potential magnetic interactions. Thanks to TESS, the authors were able to detect potential star-planet interactions between the close-in eccentric Jovian planet HD 118203b and its parent star. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02974"&gt;NGTS-30 b/TOI-4862 b: An ∼1 Gyr old 98-day transiting warm Jupiter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Battley et al. 2024)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, the longer the period of an exoplanet is the harder it is to detect it in transit data and the easier it is to detect it in radial velocity measurements – and vice versa. Planets that are detected in both photometric and spectroscopic observations are particularly valuable, especially if their orbital periods are relatively long. Battley et al. (2024) present the discovery and characterization of the Jovian planet NGTS-30 b/TOI-4862 b, utilizing data from TESS, NGTS, EulerCam, CORALIE, FEROS, HARPS, PFS, and SOAR. The G-type star was observed by TESS at long cadence in Sectors 9, 36, and 63, and produced a single transit in Sector 36 which, after careful scrutiny, was confirmed to be a genuine signal that originates from the target star. Subsequent analysis of observations from NGTS and EulerCam revealed an ingress in the former and a partial transit in the latter, both with the same depth as the transit in Sector 36 of TESS (about 1%), and suggesting a periodicity of about 98.3 days (see Fig. 2). Battley et al. (2024) combined the photometry with spectroscopic observations and speckle imagining in a global model to constrain the parameters of the system. The stellar properties extracted from the model indicate that the host star has an effective temperature Teff = 5455 K, mass Ms = 0.94 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, radius Rs = 0.91 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, Solar metallicity, and an age of about 1.1 Gyr. The authors’ analysis confirmed that the orbital period of the planet is Pp = 98.3 days, the orbital eccentricity is about ep = 0.3, its radius is Rp = 0.93 R&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt; and its mass is Mp = 0.96 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;.​ The authors estimate that the equilibrium temperature of the planet is 500K at periastron and 274 K at apoastron. Capitalizing on data from TESS, Battley et al. (2024) discovered and confirmed one of the youngest known warm Jupiters, NGTS-30 b/TOI-4862 b. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19468"&gt;The phase curve of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-167b as seen by TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Kalman et al. 2024)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WASP-167 is a pulsating F1V star hosting a transiting ultra-hot Jovian planet with an orbital period of about 2.02 days – an excellent laboratory to study in detail star-planet interactions and exoplanet atmospheres. Notably, as the host star is a rapid rotator and is both line-poor and broad-lined, radial velocity measurements of the planet’s mass are challenging. Kalman et al. (2024) present a careful analysis of the TESS phase curve of the system and refine the orbital and physical parameters of the planets and its parent star. TESS observed WASP-167 in Sectors 10, 37, and 64 at short cadence, and detected clear, periodic transits with a depth of about 0.8%, as well as prominent out-of-transit lightcurve modulations. To reproduce the TESS photometry of the target, the authors employed a comprehensive lightcurve model accounting for ellipsoidal variability, Doppler beaming, and reflection effects, as well as the influence of stellar pulsations on these. The authors confirm that the planet has an orbital period of 2.022 days, radius of 1.6 R&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;, estimate its mass to be about 0.35 M&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;, argue that the latter may be considerably underestimated due to the employed lightcurve detrending, and detect a peak in the Fourier spectrum of the target near resonance with the second orbital harmonic of  the planet. Kalman et al. (2024) show that the planet’s occultation depth is about 107 parts-per-million, measure a geometric albedo of about 0.34, and argue that the brightest point on the  planet’s surface is offset eastward by at about 17 degrees. The authors estimate the planet’s dayside temperature to be about 2800 K, significantly below the limits provided by previous ground-based data, and obtain 2-sigma upper limits on the nightside and intrinsic temperature of 2360 K and 2340 K, respectively. Thanks to TESS, Kalman et al. (2024) were able to classify WASP-167b as an ultra-hot Jupiter, constrain its physical and orbital properties, and promote it as a prime target for atmospheric studies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17592"&gt;Three Warm Jupiters around Solar-analog stars detected with TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Eberhardt et al. 2024)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massive planets on relatively short-period orbits provide important information about the processes and mechanisms responsible for the formation and evolution of planetary systems. Of these, warm Jupiters are generally considered to be sufficiently far away from their parent stars that tidal interactions are expected to be weaker. Eberhardt et al. (2024) present the discovery and characterization of three new warm Jupiters, TOI-2373 b, TOI-2416 b, and TOI-2524 b, based on TESS data and ground based follow-up observations, and as part of the Warm gIaNts with tEss (WINE) survey. The targets were observed by TESS in Sectors 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9 at 30-min cadence, and then again in Sectors 28, 29, 30, 31, 35, 38, 45, and 46 at 2-min cadence, and produced clear, periodic transits that passed all Data Validation tests. To complement the TESS data, the authors obtained photometric and spectroscopic observations from ASTEP, LCOGT, the Evans 0.36 m telescope, Observatoire Moana, SOAR, and FEROS, and performed combined analysis of all available data with the Exo-Striker code. Eberhardt et al. (2024) argue that all three host stars are similar to the Sun, with effective temperatures between 5651 K and 5831 K, masses between ~1 and ~1.1 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, radii between ~1.1 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt; and ~1.2 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt; , and ages between ~4.9 Gyr and 6.7 Gyr; one of these has a Solar metallicity while the other two are have metallicities of ~0.3 [Fe/H] (dex). For the TOI-2373 b, TOI-2416 b, and TOI-2524 b planets, the authors measure orbital periods of 13.3 days, 8.3 days, and 7.2 days, respectively, radii of 0.88R&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;, 0.9 R&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;, and 1 R&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;, masses of 9.3 M&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;, 3 M&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;, and 0.6 M&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;, and corresponding orbital eccentricities of ~0.1, ~0.3, and 0. Thanks to TESS, Eberhardt et al. (2024) were able to detect three new warm Jupiters, one of which is the densest planet known at the time of writing (TOI-2373 b). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14954"&gt;Methods for the detection of stellar rotation periods in individual TESS sectors and results from the Prime missiona&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Colman et al. 2024)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stellar rotation is one of the key ingredients in our understanding of stellar formation and evolution, and provides vital constraints on the ages of stars through the process of gyrochronology. Colman et al. (2024) present a comprehensive analysis of rotational variability in stars observed at 2-min cadence by TESS in Cycles 1 and 2 (Sectors 1 through 26). The authors developed a custom pipeline to investigate 194,336 distinct FGKM dwarfs spread across 432,704 Sectors and selected according to the following constraints: (i) effective temperatures T &amp;lt;= 7,000K; (ii) fainter than T = 5 mag (to avoid saturation issues); and (iii) brighter than T = 16 mag (to ensure robust detection of relevant lightcurve features). Additionally, the authors Colman et al. (2024) focus their period search on individual Sectors, with a theoretical limit of ~12 days imposed by the data downlink gaps in each Sector. For vetting purposes, the authors utilize a random forest classifier based on lightcurve data only (the classifier has no knowledge of magnitudes, effective temperatures, etc) and trained on period measurements obtained from KELT and TESS Full-Frame Image lightcurves. Colman et al. (2024) performed Lomb-Scargle and autocorrelation function analysis to detect stellar rotation in 17,110 lightcurves; 16,800 of these (across 11,010 targets) passed all their vetting tests. The authors argue that the overall fraction of detected rotation periods is 3.75% for all sectors analyzed, corresponding to 5.82% of all targets analyzed, and note that while most of the detected periods are shorter than 12 days, many stars are likely rotationally-variable on longer timescales. Indeed, the authors indeed found 30 potential rotation periods longer than 12 days by performing visual inspection. Overall, capitalizing on 2-min observations from TESS, Colman et al. (2024) created a catalog of rotation periods for 10,909 FGKM dwarfs of which 4,936 are new detections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16642"&gt;Pulsating hydrogen-deficient white dwarfs and pre-white dwarfs observed with TESS VI. Asteroseismology of the GW Vir-type central star of the Planetary Nebula NGC 246&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Calcaferro et al. 2024)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NGC 246 is a planetary nebula with a slightly elliptical shape, at the center of which is a hierarchical triple stellar system. This unique system consists of the primary HIP 3678 A, a PG 1159 pulsating white dwarf with an estimated effective temperature of Teff ~ 150,000K and log(g) ~ 5.7, and the likely low-mass K- and M-type main sequence secondary and tertiary stars HIP 3678 B and C. Calcaferro et al. (2024) present a detailed asteroseismic analysis of HIP 3678 A based on TESS data from Sectors 3 (at 120-sec cadence) and 30 (at 120-sec and 20-sec cadence). The authors note that the two major sources of contamination are the resolved tertiary star HIP 3678 B (at angular separation of ~4 arcsec and magnitude difference of deltaT = 0.6 mag) and the nearby field star TYC 5272-1854-1 (separation of ~56 arcsec and magnitude difference of deltaT = -1.2 mag), and argue that neither these nor the nebula itself are a significant source of contamination. Calcaferro et al. (2024) computed Fourier transforms of the lightcurves, extracted 17 distinct periodicities in the range of ~1460 to ~1823 sec (associated with non-radial g-mode pulsations), and found no indications of rotational multiples. Thanks to TESS data, the authors were able to measure a constant period spacing of 12.9 sec and constrain the mass of the primary star of NGC 246 to be either 0.87 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt; (if the period spacing is associated with l = 1 modes) or 0.57 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt; (if the period spacing is associated with l = 2 modes), with the latter being more consistent with Gaia measurements. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, we are looking at three recent papers from the archive. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14068"&gt;The Peculiar Bursting Nature of CP Pup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Veresvarska et al. 2024)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CP Puppis is a cataclysmic variable that produced a bright, fast nova explosion in 1942, and has been the subject of intense studies ever since. The system exhibits several peculiarities such as potential orbital period below the period gap (~1.6 hrs vs 3 hrs), uncertain accretion rate, and occasional bursts in ASAS-SN data. Veresvarska et al. (2024) present results from a detailed study of the TESS photometry of CP Pup aimed at better understanding the properties of the system. TESS observed CP Pup at 2-min cadence in Sectors 7, 8, 34, and 35, and at 20-sec cadence in Sector 61, and the authors detected prominent lightcurve modulations in all Sectors, with typical variance timescales of ~10 days. The authors report the detection of two bursts in Sectors 7 and 34 with typical durations of less than 1 day and amplitudes greater than 2. The energies estimated for each burst are  ~1x10&lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt; erg and ~6x10&lt;sup&gt;37&lt;sup&gt; ergs for Sectors 7 and 34, respectively, with only Sector 34 covering both the pre- and post-burst phases. Additionally, Veresvarska et al. (2024) argue that the known period cluster at ~1.5-1.6 hrs is present in all available TESS data, and identify a persistent signal at 16.29+/-0.04 cycles/day. Assuming CP Pup is a magnetic system, Veresvarska et al. (2024) combine TESS photometry with ASAS-SN data to test whether the detected bursts are consistent with micronova eruptions triggered by localized thermonuclear explosions. While the authors find no conclusive evidence to unambiguously untangle the puzzle of the CP Pup system, thanks to the long baseline provided by TESS data they were able to test various hypotheses for its peculiar observational features and suggest that a long orbital period may be a viable explanation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11037"&gt;Searching the SN 1987A SETI Ellipsoid with TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Cabrales et al. 2024)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SN 1987A was a B3 supergiant in the Large Magellanic Cloud that exploded as a Type II core collapse supernova in May 1987, reaching a peak apparent magnitude of 2.9 and representing the closest observed supernova in more than 400 years. Such spectacular events are suggested to be prime candidates for SETI ellipsoid observations -- a target-prioritization strategy for the detection of technosignatures based on focal ("Shelling") points. In particular, it is hypothesized that such events can provide common reference for one extraterrestrial civilization to broadcast its presence to another without establishing direct contact. Cabrales et al. (2024) present a detailed analysis of and search for anomalous signatures in the TESS lightcurves of targets within the SETI ellipsoid of SN1987A, which is represented by a time-dependent ellipsoid with one foci at SN1987A and the other at Earth. In particular, the authors examined ~15,000 targets in the continuous viewing zone of TESS that were observed at 2-min cadence in at least 11 sectors in a given cycle, regardless of their stellar type, configuration, or habitability prospects. Of these, Cabrales et al. (2024) identify 12 and 24 potential targets of interest within 0.5 lightyears of SN1987A during Cycle 1 and 3, respectively. The authors did not detect anomalous lightcurve  features, demonstrated the utility of combining TESS observations with Gaia measurements for a technosignatures search based on a flexible SETI ellipsoid, and argue that the target sample could be increased by decreasing the targets’ distance to Earth. Additionally, Cabrales et al. (2024) suggest that the Full Frame Image lightcurves might be preferred over the 2-min cadence data as the former may not be processed for the removal of long-term trends, and note that longer observations would be needed to monitor targets farther away from Earth. The long-duration, nearly-continuous observations from TESS provided sufficient information to the authors to establish a baseline photometric pattern of the examined targets for the detection of anomalous signatures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07800"&gt;TIaRA TESS 1: Estimating exoplanet yields from Year 1 and Year 3 SPOC lightcurves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Rodel et al. 2024)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing, TESS has enabled the detection of more than 10,000 TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs) as well as more than 3,000 community TOIs (cTOIs). Of these, the relatively longer-period population is particularly interesting as, for example, potential targets for atmospheric characterization – yet more challenging to detect due to the correspondingly smaller number of transits produced over the course of the TESS observations. Rodel et al. (2024) present a detailed analysis of the detection sensitivity of TESS and provide an up-to-date planet yield estimate, with a particular focus on planets with orbital periods longer than 25 days that produce one transit per cycle (“monotransits”). The authors combine the SPOC-FFI lighturves from Cycles 1 and 3 with a custom-designed pipeline and occurrence rates to calculate the corresponding transit probability as a function of the planet’s orbital period (up to 400 days), radius (up to 16 R&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;) and stellar type (A through M). Rodel et al. (2024) argue that TESS should be able to detect ~80% of planets with R &amp;gt; 8 R&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt; and  P &amp;lt; 6.25 days, less than half of planets with R &amp;lt; 4 R&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;, and less than 1% of Earth-size planets. The authors calculate a total expected yield of ~2271 planets from SPOC FFI Cycles 1 and 3 (including ~215 monotransits), ~400 of which have P &amp;gt; 25 days and ~110 with P &amp;gt; 100 days. Rodel et al. (2024) note that while the estimated yields are 1(2)-sigma consistent with the TOI catalog for planets with P &amp;lt; 6.25(25)days, the expected yields for P &amp;gt; 25 days are 3 times higher than the known candidates. This suggests that many more long-period planets are still expected to be discovered in TESS data.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01477"&gt;The First TESS Self-Lensing Pulses: Revisiting KIC 12254688&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Sorabella et al. 2024)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, a binary system containing a compact object can have just the right orbital and physical configuration such that it is not only an eclipsing binary, but also a self-lensing eclipsing binary. These are systems where the compact object is responsible for a gravitational lensing effect strong enough to produce a brightening “pulse” at primary conjunction instead of a dimming eclipse. Five such systems have been confirmed to date, all from Kepler data. Sorabella et al. (2024) present results from a search for new self-lensing binaries in TESS data. The authors detected a large number of asteroid crossings that mimic self-lensing pulses, demonstrating the feasibility of their search strategy, but did not find new self-lensing candidates. Interestingly, TESS was at the right place at the right time to observe the known system KIC 12254688 during primary conjunctions, and Sorabella et al. (2024) were able to detect two brightening pulses from the system in TESS lightcurves from Sectors 41 and 56. Utilizing short-cadence data, the authors removed common systematics, extracted the two pulses from the binned data, modeled the available photometry and spectroscopy, and obtained best-fit parameters that are broadly consistent with previous results (albeit with larger uncertainties). The authors note that if KIC 12254688 was not known as a self-lensing binary it might have been difficult to identify it as such in TESS lightcurves and argue that self-lensing systems containing a black hole instead of a white dwarf would be comparably easier to detect, especially in data from the extended mission. The two self-lensing brightening pulses from KIC 12254688 reported by Sorabella et al. (2024) are the first such events detected in TESS data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16248"&gt;TIC 184743498: The First Tri-Axial Stellar Pulsator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Zhang et al. 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stellar pulsations have long been used as important tracers for the mechanisms and processes underlying the structure, formation and evolution of stars. Photometric observations have helped distinguish several classes of pulsating stars and revealed a complex landscape of pulsation timescales, amplitudes, and modes. For example, rapidly oscillating Ap stars can produce non-radial pulsation modes along an axis that is not only misaligned with respect to the stellar rotation but can be also offset from the center of mass. Zhang et al. (2023) present the TESS-enabled discovery of the tri-axial stellar pulsator TIC 184743498. The target is a close binary system containing a delta Scuti primary star, and was observed by TESS in long candece in Sectors 8, 34, 35, 61 and in short cadence in Sector 62. The binary has a period of about 1 day and shows eclipse timing variations following a parabolic curve which indicate either orbital decay or perturbations due to a third body. The latter interpretation is consistent with Gaia measurements and suggests a ~0.7-1.3 &lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt; third star with an outer orbital period of ~2,000-6,000 days. The delta Scuti primary has a mass of ~1.8 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, radius of ~1.7 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, and effective temperature of ~8,500 K, and produces at least nine tidally-tilted pulsation modes. Five of these peak at conjunctions and represent pulsations along the tidal axis, while the other peak at the maxima of the ellipsoidal variations and represent pulsations along an axis orthogonal to the tidal axis and to the angular momentum axis. Thanks to TESS, Zhang et al. (2023) were able to discover the first tri-axial stellar pulsator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17272"&gt;Signs of magnetic star-planet interactions in HD 118203. TESS detects stellar variability that matches the orbital period of a close-in eccentric Jupiter-sized companion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Castro-González et al. 2024)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HD 118203 is host to a Jovian planet with an orbital period of 6.1 days and eccentricity of 0.3 – a sparsely populated parameter space. The configuration of the system is such that the planet is massive enough and close enough to the parent star that tidal and magnetic star-planet interactions can manifest as observable signatures. Castro-González et al. (2024) combine TESS photometry with spectroscopic measurements and archival observations to search for such signatures in HD 118203 – a relatively bright, nearby star (V ~ 8 mag, distance of ~ 92 pc). The target was observed by TESS in short cadence in Sectors 15, 16, 22, and 49 and, along with the planetary transits, exhibits prominent out-of-transit lightcurve variations as well as indications for a long-term linear trend in the measured radial velocities. The authors report that the sinusoidal photometric variability is present in all four sectors, has a periodicity of ~6.1 days, effectively matching the orbital period of the planet, varies in both shape and in amplitude, and can appear and disappear on orbital timescales. Castro-González et al. (2024) interpret this as a potential signature of magnetic interactions between the star and its planet, note that stellar rotation origin is unlikely, and argue that a confirmation could be achieved through follow-up photometric and spectroscopic observations. Additionally, the authors also refine the orbital ephemeris, and argue that the expected rotation period of the planet is about 3.7 days. Capitalizing on TESS data, Castro-González et al. (2024) were able to find strong evidence for magnetic star-planet interactions in short-period, eccentric planetary systems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, we are looking at three recent papers from the archive. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16691"&gt;Unveiling the spectacular over 24-hour flare of star CD-36 3202&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Bicz et al. 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies of stellar activity provide deeper insight into the mechanisms and processes governing the formation, internal structure, and evolution of stars. CD-36 3202 is an active K2V star with a mass of 0.8 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, radius of 0.8 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, effective temperature of 4885 K, age of ~40 Myr and a rotation period of about 5.6 hours. Bicz et al. (2023) present a comprehensive analysis of the TESS photometry of CD-36 3202, aimed at better understanding the flaring activity as well as the distribution and properties of starspots. TESS observed the target in Sectors 6, 7, 33, 34, and 61, and detected a prominent variability signal suggesting spot-induced modulations with an amplitude of ~5-6%, as well as stellar flares. Focusing on the 2-min data from Sectors 6 and 7, Bicz et al. (2023) reconstructed the lightcurve of the target by simulating a spotted star with flares, adjusting the amplitude, size, longitude and latitude of the spots, as well as the location and profile of the flares. The authors obtained a best-fit solution from a model with stellar inclination of ~70 degrees, three non-overlapping spots separated by about 80 and 50 degrees in longitude and at latitudes of about -55, 50, and 60 degrees, and relative amplitudes between 1.5% and 2.5%. Each spot covers about 4% of the stellar surface and has a mean temperature of ~4,000 K. Bicz et al. (2023) noted that the white-light flare region exhibits a clear solar-like behavior and estimated that the flare detected in Sector 6 lasted for ~27 hours. Their model indicates that the flaring region has a radius of ~3 degrees, temperature of about 10,000 K, bolometric energy of 4x10&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt; erg, and is located at a latitude of ~70 degrees and longitude of ~100 degrees. Capitalizing on TESS observations, the authors argued that they were able to estimate the location of a flare region relative to the location of the stops for the first time, and suggested that partially-convective K stars like CD-36 3202 are prime targets for deeper analysis of stellar activity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03319"&gt;Search for Planets in Hot Jupiter Systems with Multi-Sector TESS Photometry. IV. Null Detections in 12 Systems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Maciejewski et al. 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as planets go, hot Jupiters – gas giants with short orbital periods – are relatively rare and in the vast majority of cases quite lonely. However, some of them do reside in multi-planet systems, which presents a certain challenge to the established theoretical framework outlining their formation and evolution.  Maciejewski et al. (2023) present results from an ongoing search for additional, low-mass planet candidates in 12 systems with known hot Jupiter – HAT-P-24, HAT-P-39, HAT-P-42, HAT-P-50, KELT-2, KELT-15, KELT-17, WASP-23, WASP-63, WASP-76, WASP-79, and WASP-161. The authors used 2-min and 30-min TESS lightcurves from multiple sectors to refine the corresponding transit models and ephemerides of the known planets, focusing on transits with complete photometric coverage and taking into account potential trends in the data as well as contamination from nearby sources. Additionally, Maciejewski et al. (2023) investigated the data for potential long-term deviations from strict periodicity by evaluating quadratic ephemerides and testing for periodic signals in the transit-timing residuals, searched for additional (periodic) transit-like events on timescales of 0.2 to 100 days, and performed injection-and-retrieval tests to evaluate the detection efficiency. Their analysis revealed no additional transiting planet candidates larger than 2-4 R&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;, and ruled out long-term period variations for 10 of the investigated systems further strengthening the loneliness hypothesis for these hot Jupiters. The authors note that one of these is WASP-161, a system where previous results suggested hints of potential deviations from linear ephemeris, investigate a few potential options for the apparent discrepancy, and conclude that its origin remains unclear. Interestingly, the TESS data allowed Maciejewski et al. (2023) to find potential hints that the orbital period of WASP-79 b is decreasing and measure potential short-period transit-timing variations for KELT-2A b which could be indicate of a signal from an exomoon.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03845"&gt;A Nearby Polluted White Dwarf with a 6.2 h Spin Period&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Farihi et al. 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 20% to 30% of the nearby white dwarfs exhibit a pronounced enrichment in heavy elements, and a comparable fraction are known to be magnetic. A correlation between metal pollution and magnetisms is typically associated with the stars’ cooling age, along with an observational bias against detecting magnetic fields in unpolluted cool white dwarfs. Farihi et al. (2023) report the first detection of periodic modulations in the lightcurve of a polluted white dwarf, WD 2138–332, utilizing 2-min TESS data from Sector 68. At a distance of 16 pc and with a G magnitude of 14.5, the target is amongst the nearest and brightest white dwarfs. It has an effective temperature of about 6,900 K, mass of 0.6 MSun, age of 1.7 Gyr, and a magnetic field strength of about 50 kG, and exhibits a classical DZ spectrum with prominent CaII H &amp;amp; K, Mg and Fe lines. Farihi et al. (2023) combined TESS data with observations from ULTRACAM and detected a sinusoidal photometric variability, corresponding to a single periodogram peak with an amplitude of about 0.4% at a frequency of 3.87 d&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (~6.2 hours). Additionally, Farihi et al. (2023) found that 6 of the 23 metal-free, magnetic white dwarfs within 20 pc have TESS light curves consistent with rotationally-induced modulations while none of the 16 confirmed polluted and/or magnetic white dwarfs show signs of photometric periodicity. Capitalizing on the TESS data, the authors attribute the variability of WD 2138–332 to rotational-induced modulations, note that there is a weak but clear secondary minimum near phase of 0.5, and argue that the variability is comparable to detections and upper limits of similar stars. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02368"&gt;Rapid Optical Flares in the Blazar OJ 287 on Intraday Timescales with TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Kishore et al. 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radio loud Aactive Ggalactic Nnuclei (AGN) exhibit multiwavelength variability spanning a wide range of timescales. Observations of optical variability on short timescales provide important clues towards better understanding the processes operating in the innermost regions of the blazar. Kishore et al. (2023) present analysis of TESS photometry of the blazar OJ 28, an AGN at a redshift of z = 0.306 producing outbursts on timescales of ~12 years, and a likely host to a binary supermassive black hole. TESS observed the target in Sectors 44, 45, and 46 at 2-min cadence, detecting prominent variability in all three sectors, including flares. The authors split the data into six segments (two for each Ssector), evaluated the excess flux variance, and performed Lomb-Scargle periodogram and Continuous Auto-Regressive Moving Average analysis. Kishore et al. (2023) show that the two flares detected in Sector 45 correspond to a brightness increase of ∼81% and ∼194%, respectively, with likely doubling rise times of about 0.4 days. The authors argue that the flares represent a prominent outburst event not present in the rest of the data, and note that the rise of the flares is rapid and monotonic while the decay is slower and exhibits discontinuities, which they interpret as an indication that the cooling time is longer than the light-crossing time. Kishore et al. (2023) measured power spectral density slopes between -1.5 and -2.5, noted that the rise of the first flare exhibits the shortest variability timescale occurred (t = 0.38 days), and estimated that the size of the emitting region is between 2.2 and 6.3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;^15&lt;/sup&gt; cm. Thanks to observations from TESS, the authors were able to constrain the origin of the optical emission of the blazar OJ 287 to a compact region in the relativistic jet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02154"&gt;A Blind Search for Transit Depth Variability with TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Wang &amp;amp; Espinoza 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparent changes in the measured depth of consecutive transits could be used to shed light on the atmospheric properties and/or oblateness of the planet, the variability of the host star, the orbital dynamics of the systems, as well as the instrumental and/or data-processing systematics associated with the data itself. Wang &amp;amp; Espinoza (2023) present results from a blind search for transit depth variations in 330 known planets spanning a wide range of physical and orbital parameters. The targets were observed by TESS in Sectors 1 through 57 at 2-min cadence, produced more than five transits with a SNR greater than 5, and did not exhibit transit-timing variations larger than 0.1 days. The authors focused on modeling the data at the individual transit level, scrutinized the transit depths for indications of periodicity, and searched for correlations between the measured transit depth variations and the corresponding stellar activity. To account for potential Ssector-by-Ssector transit depth variability induced by contamination from a nearby sourcer, Wang &amp;amp; Espinoza (2023) fit all transits in a particular Ssector, with corresponding out-of-transit Gaussian Process posteriors as priors, and identify targets with 3-sigma transit depth discrepancy between Ssectors. The authors show that the majority of the studied targets do not exhibit transit depth variations above the expected noise levels. Wang &amp;amp; Espinoza (2023) demonstrated that four of the targets – KELT-8b, HAT-P-7b, TrES-3b, and HIP 65Ab – show strong indications for transit depth variability. Of these, the authors attribute the variability of KELT-8b to contamination from a nearby stellar variable, and note that the measured transit depth variations for TrES-3b and HIP 65Ab are likely an artifact of the relative high impact parameters (&amp;gt;0.8). Thanks to TESS, Wang &amp;amp; Espinoza (2023) highlight the remaining target, HAT-P-7b, as worthy of further investigations due to the potential indications of real transit depth variations originating from either the planet itself, or the host star. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15833"&gt;The positional probability and true host star identification of TESS exoplanet candidates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Hadjigeorghiou &amp;amp; Armstrong 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Background and/or foreground contamination from nearby sources is a common problem for photometric surveys, and identifying the origin of detected transit- or eclipse-like events is a vital part of the discovery process. Typically, the contamination is due to nearby eclipsing binaries or variable stars that contribute sufficient amount of flux to the target’s aperture to significantly affect the extracted lightcurve. Hadjigeorghiou &amp;amp; Armstrong (2023) present a new method for identifying the true source of transiting events detected in TESS data utilizing Gaia data. The method calculates the flux contribution from all resolved sources within a radius of 168 arcsec from the target star (down to a magnitude difference of deltaT = 10 mag), determines the respective flux-weighted center-of-light positions of the detected events for the corresponding model aperture, and provides a per-Ssector probabilistic estimate as to the likelihood of these events originating from the resolved sources, including the respective uncertainties. The authors applied the method to 3226 TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs) and correctly identified 96.5 % of the host stars for 655 known exoplanets. The method indicated that a nearby source is the likely origin of the detected events for 96.5 % of the targets associated with 142 confirmed nearby eclipsing binaries and nearby planet candidates, and suggested that 293 out of 2365 active planet candidates are likely off-target false positives (~12%). The positional probabilities for about 3.4% of the tested cases were not consistent with the author’s expectations which they attribute to low SNR events, targets in crowded fields, model uncertainties or host stars in resolved visual binaries. Hadjigeorghiou &amp;amp; Armstrong (2023) note that the method has a relatively fast runtime (about a minute per target), requires minimal resources, and can be easily parallelized. The authors argue that this can facilitate the rapid vetting and validation process of detected TOIs, which would further improve the scientific impact of the TESS mission. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has been in operation since July 2018, monitoring millions of stars across the entire sky and discovering thousands of exoplanets and exoplanet candidates. The field of view observed approximately each month by TESS is 24 x 96 degrees, with data collected at a 200-second cadence. TESS's capability for precision photometry over long time baselines, as well as open access to the data, have resulted in extraordinarily high scientific output from the mission across a broad range of astrophysics.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our TESS Workshop will consist of; i) short talks introducing the NASA TESS mission ii) explanations of how to propose for TESS observations and obtain research funding in upcoming proposal calls iii) tutorials on working with TESS data and iv) an interactive work-with-the-experts session to show you how to work with TESS data on your own targets. Please &lt;a href="https://aas.org/meetings/aas243/registration"&gt;register online&lt;/a&gt; for this &lt;strong&gt;free interactive session&lt;/strong&gt; and remember to bring a laptop! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the TESS Splinter Session we will provide an overview of the TESS Mission operations and science goals. We highlight TESS's impact across all areas of astronomy, sharing some of the amazing new science being conducted with TESS including exoplanet detections, stellar physics, and discoveries of transient events and other time-domain phenomena. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look forward to seeing you at the AAS!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, we are looking at three recent papers from the archive. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14200"&gt;101 Eclipsing Quadruple Star Candidates Discovered in TESS Full Frame Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Kostov et al. 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple stellar systems represent a natural outcome of stellar formation and evolution, come in a wide variety of orbital configurations, and span a range of physical properties and evolutionary stages. These systems present excellent opportunities to test theoretical models of stellar astrophysics and study in detail the corresponding processes and mechanisms in dynamically-complex environments. Kostov et al. (2023) present the TESS-enabled discovery and characterization of 101 new quadruple star candidates. The targets have a 2+2 hierarchical configuration and contain two eclipsing binary stars producing two distinct sets of eclipses in TESS data. The candidates have all been detected by visual inspection of the respective TESS photometry, using long-cadence light curves from Sectors 1 through 54, performed by a dedicated team of citizen scientists. The authors perform detailed pixel-level analysis and utilize comprehensive photocenter measurements to rule out common false positives and confirm that the corresponding target is the source of both sets of detected eclipses. As an additional layer of scrutiny, Kostov et al. (2023)  confirmed that the two sets of eclipses detected in TESS data are also present in archival photometry from the ASAS-SN, ATLAS, and ZTF surveys where crowding is less of a concern. A number of targets show prominent eclipse timing variations, suggesting dynamical interactions between the two component subsystems, several candidates have outer orbits confirmed by Gaia measurements, and one system is a potential quintuple candidate with a (2+1)+2 hierarchical configuration. Thanks to TESS data, Kostov et al. (2023) were able to significantly increase the number of uniformly-vetted quadruple star candidates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08631"&gt;The Rapid Optical Variability of the Nearby Radio-Loud AGN Pictor A: Introducing the Quaver Pipeline for AGN Science with TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Smith &amp;amp; Sartori 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About one in ten Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) produce powerful jets that can often dwarf in size the host galaxy itself. These jets act as an important feedback mechanism in the evolution of galaxies and represent an active area of research. Jets are typically observed in radio frequencies and can exhibit complicated variability patterns in the optical regime, likely driven by the complex underlying accretion processes. Smith &amp;amp; Sartori (2023) present a new, publicly-available software tool (Quaver) specifically designed for the extraction of high-cadence TESS photometry of extended faint sources, and utilize it to perform a comprehensive analysis of the optical variability of the AGN in Pictor A. The target is the nearest broad-line radio galaxy (z = 0.035) with a prominent double-lobe structure, a parsec-scale jet, a gamma-ray emitter, and a supermassive black hole with an estimated mass of M= 5.9 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;. TESS observed Pictor A in Sectors 3, 4, 5, 31, and 33 and produced photometric variability consistent with a damped random walk model characterized by both stochastic variations and flares. To take into account the contribution of scattered light to the lightcurves of extended sources such as AGNs and remove it from the TESS photometry, Quavor uses three different methods: a simple hybrid approach, a full hybrid method, and principal component analysis. Utilizing the tool, Smith &amp;amp; Sartori (2023) measured characteristic variability timescales of about 1 day when flares dominate the TESS photometry and about 3 to 6 days for the rest of the lightcurve, both in line with expectations based on the mass of Pictor A’s black hole, and consistent with those of similar radio-loud AGNs. Utilizing TESS photometry, the authors present a detailed temporal and spectral analysis of the optical variability of the benchmark AGN Pictor A. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04809"&gt;Asteroseismological analysis of the polluted ZZ Ceti star G29-38 with TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Uzundag et al. 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZZ Ceti stars are pulsating white dwarfs with effective temperatures of ~10,000 - 14,000 K and H-rich atmospheres exhibiting multiple periods in the range of ~100 - 1,400 sec. At a distance of 17.5 pc and with a magnitude of V = 13 mag, G29-38 is one of the closest and brightest such pulsators, and a prime laboratory to study this class of pulsators. Uzundag et al. (2023) present a thorough analysis and detailed asteroseismological modeling of the pulsation properties of G29-38 using TESS data. The target was observed by the spacecraft in Sectors 42 and 50 in 2-min and 20-sec cadence, respectively, and produced a complex frequency spectrum in the ~100 to ~4,500 micro Hz regime. Utilizing a nonlinear least square algorithm, Uzundag et al. (2023) detected g-mode associated 60 frequencies in Sector 42, and 66 frequencies in Sector 50 above a detection limit of 0.1% false alarm probability of about 0.5 parts-per-thousand, as well as about 30 combination frequencies in each sector. Altogether, the authors measured a median noise level of about 0.1 parts-per-thousand of the Fourier Transform and a signal-to-noise of the detected frequencies in the range of ~5-150. Uzundag et al. (2023) marked 28 of the Sector 42 frequencies and 38 of the Sector 50 frequencies as significant, with periods from ~260 sec to  ~1,400 sec, and found four complete triplets and one quintuplet with mean separations of 4.67 micro Hz and 6.67 micro Hz, respectively, corresponding to a rotation period of about 1.35 days. The authors derived an effective temperature of T&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; = 11,635 K, surface gravity log g = 8, mass of 0.632 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, mass of H envelope of 5.6x10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, radius log(R/R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;) = -1.9, luminosity log(L/L&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;) = -2.6, and distance of  17.54 pc, consistent with previous results and in line with other ZZ Ceti pulsators with similar characteristics. Thanks to data from TESS, Uzundag et al. (2023) were able to obtain precise measurements of a bright, nearby ZZ Ceti pulsator. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01639"&gt;Four New Compact Triply Eclipsing Triples found with Gaia and TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Czavalinga et al. 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triply eclipsing triples represent a special geometrical configuration where an eclipsing binary is itself eclipsed and/or occulted by the tertiary star. These provide an excellent opportunity to study stellar formation and evolution in multiple systems. Czavalinga et al. (2023) present the discovery and analysis of four triply eclipsing triples TIC 88206187, TIC 14839347, TIC 298714297, and TIC 66893949. The authors utilized data from TESS, Gaia, ASAS-SN and ATLAS, spectral energy distribution, measured eclipse timing variations, and theoretical stellar evolution models. The four targets were observed by TESS in Sectors 14, 15, 19, 41, 55, 56, and 59 in long cadence, and all produced primary and secondary eclipses as well as prominent tertiary body eclipses; the binary eclipses are also readily seen in the archival photometry from ASAS-SN and ATLAS. Additionally, Gaia’s Non-Single-Star solutions confirm the triple nature of the systems, the lightcurves of three of the targets (TIC 88206187, TIC 14839347, TIC 298714297) exhibit notable ellipsoidal variations. The TESS photometry of  TIC 298714297  also shows a clear rotational signal with a periodicity comparable to the orbital period of the inner binary. The authors combined all the available data into a comprehensive spectrophotometric-dynamical model and found that TIC 88206187, TIC 14839347, TIC 298714297, and TIC 66893949 are generally similar to known triply eclipsing triple systems. In particular, the component stars have masses in the range of 0.5 to 2.5 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, radii between 0.5 and 11.7 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, effective temperatures from ~3,600 K to ~9,000 K, and all four systems are nearly coplanar with mutual inclinations smaller than about 4 degrees. The inner orbital periods range between 1.1 and 4.8 days, with corresponding negligible eccentricities, while the outer periods are between 53 and 471 days, with relatively high eccentricity for TIC 66893949 (0.4). At a distance of about 140 pc, TIC 298714297 is one of the closest known triply eclipsing triples, and TIC 88206187 is one of the three known such systems where the outer period is short enough for potential tidal interactions between the inner binary and the tertiary star. Thanks to TESS data, Czavalinga et al. (2023) derived highly accurate physical and orbital parameters of four triply-ecliping triples, reaching percent-level precision on the individual stellar masses and sizes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16106"&gt;TESS light curves of cataclysmic variables -- III -- More superhump systems among old novae and novalike variables&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Bruch 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are interacting binary stars where the orbital period is short enough for a late-type unevolved component to transfer mass to a white dwarf component via Roche-lobe overflow. If there is an accretion disk around the compact object, and depending on the mass transfer rate, CVs are classified as either dwarf novae or novalike variables. Bruch (2023) presents a detailed analysis of 23 novalike variables and old novae aimed at characterizing periodic and non-periodic photometric variations. The targets were drawn from a sample of 127 such stars listed in the Ritter &amp;amp; Kolb (2003) catalog, do not include AM Her type stars, and were all observed by TESS in short-cadence. The author utilized Fourier techniques and Lomb-Scargle analysis to calculate periodograms, without quantifying the respective false alarm probability. Bruch (2023) found that the lightcurves of all 23 studied targets show clear positive or negative superhumps, noted that the superhumps are detected for the first time in 19 out of the 23 systems, and argued that these represent a 50% increase in the number of novalike variable and old novae exhibiting such variability. The author explored the periodicity, consistency, variability, and waveform of the superhumps, and updated the corresponding orbital &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;periods for half of the investigated systems. Specifically, Bruch (2023) indicated that the negative superhumps dominate the positive superhumps by a factor of ~2.4 and argued that the Stolz-Schoembs relation between the superhump period and period excess for novalike variables needs to be updated. The author also highlighted 4 novalike variables exhibiting long-period quasi-periodic oscillations with periods in the following ranges: LS Cam 0.8 - 0.85 hours; LN UMa 2.2 - 2.7 hours; CN Vel 1.85 - 2.50; HS 0642 1.7 - 2.4 hours and 12 - 36 hours. Notably, the latter mandates the use of TESS photometry as covering the long timescale from the ground would be highly challenging. Utilizing the unique capabilities of TESS, Bruch (2023) argued that superhumps in novalike variables are more common than previously thought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10344"&gt;A Surprising Periodicity Detected During a Super-outburst of V844 Herculis by TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Greiveldinger et al. 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of cataclysmic variables, V844 Her is an SU UMa type dwarf nova with an orbital period of ~78 minutes showing evidence for both normal (and rare) outbursts and bright super-outbursts. The latter typically occur on a timescale of ~300 days. Greiveldinger et al. (2023) used TESS data to detect a super-outburst from V844 Her with an unexpected periodicity of about 29.3 minutes. The target was observed by TESS in Sectors 24, 25, 51, and 52 in 2-min cadence. It was in a super-outburst mode during Sector 24 and in a quiescent mode during the rest of the observations. It exhibits prominent superhump oscillations with a period of about 17.9 days, which are broadened by the archetypal SU UMa frequency variations. The 29.3-min signal identified by the authors is characterized by a narrow, unresolved periodogram peak. Greiveldinger et al. (2023) note that this is in contrast to the typical superhump frequencies associated with outbursts of this type of cataclysmic variables. The strength of the signal slowly decreases during Sector 24 and is still detectable in Sector 25, but is not present in Sectors 51 and 52. The authors utilized difference imaging to rule out data artifacts and confirm that the target is indeed the source of the 29.3 min signal. Additionally, Greiveldinger et al. (2023) searched for the signal during the quiescent stage in archival and follow-up observations of V844 Her from AAVSO, the MDM 1.3 m McGraw- Hill telescope, and XMM Newton but did not detect the oscillations. The authors note that the 29.3 min periodicity is not correlated with the known superhump variations, and is comparably more complex. Greiveldinger et al. (2023) argue that V844 Her might not be a typical intermediate polar due to its relatively low X-ray luminosity, suggest that the 29.3 min variations are mostly likely produced by the rotation of the white dwarf, and note that follow-up UV observations could test this hypothesis. TESS data enabled the detection of a surprising oscillations signal in the non-typical SU UMa type dwarf novae V844 Her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data validation products (full- and mini-report PDFs, one-page TCE report summary PDFs, time series FITS files, and DV results XML files) for Sector 66 have been updated. The target pixel and light curve FITS files for Sector 66 have not been updated, however. The data validation module was inadvertently run twice in the SPOC pipeline at NASA Ames. The first delivery included intermixed products from the two runs. The data validation algorithms are deterministic, but time limits while running the DV module can affect results for individual target stars. This update provides a fully consistent set of data validation products for Sector 66.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The files in the new delivery replace existing archival products with identical file names. The updated data validation time series products can best be identified by examining the "DATE" keyword, which identifies the date that the file was created. Any time series file with a DATE of "2023-08-25" corresponds to an updated data product. Furthermore, the generation date ("Date Generated") displayed on the stand-alone one-page TCE summaries should exactly match the generation date on the one-page summaries displayed at the beginning of the data validation mini-report for the same target star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We suggest that any/all Sector 66 data validation product(s) downloaded from MAST prior to 2023-09-06 be replaced with an updated version. After 2023-09-06, the old files will no longer be available.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="news"></category></entry><entry><title>TESS Weekly Bulletin: Aug 22nd</title><link href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/tess-weekly-bulletin-aug-22nd.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-22T10:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-08-22T10:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Veselin Kostov</name></author><id>tag:heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov,2023-08-22:/docs/tess/tess-weekly-bulletin-aug-22nd.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers to our latest news bulletin!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14081"&gt;TIC 43152097. The first eclipsing binary in NGC 2232&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Frasca et al. 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eclipsing binary stars have long been used as fundamental calibrators for precise stellar masses, sizes, and effective temperatures. Young systems containing active late-type stars are particularly important as they can help address a long-standing disagreement between measured and theoretically-predicted stellar radii. Frasca et al. (2023) present the discovery and detailed characterization of the young, totally eclipsing binary system TIC 43152097 – a member of the young open cluster NGC 2232 with an estimated age of 28-38 Myr and Solar metallicity. The authors combine TESS photometry from Sectors 6 and  33 with follow-up photometric and spectroscopic observations from OACT and HARPS-N to derive precise parameters for the system. Frasca et al. (2023) note that the TESS lightcurve outside the observed eclipses exhibits modulations with an amplitude of 15-20 mmag and period consistent with the orbital period of the binary system, suggesting the presence of cool spots on one or both stars that are rotating synchronously (or pseudo-synchronously) with the binary. The author’s analysis demonstrates that TIC 43152097 consists of a late F-type primary and a late K-type secondary orbiting each other every 3.7 days with negligible eccentricity. The measured orbital and stellar parameters of the two components are as follows: M&lt;sub&gt;primary&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.16 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;primary&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.12 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, Teff&lt;sub&gt;primary&lt;/sub&gt; = 6070 K; M&lt;sub&gt;secondary&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.76 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;secondary&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.89 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, Teff&lt;sub&gt;secondary&lt;/sub&gt; = 4130 K. Frasca et al. (2023) note that the primary has already reached the main sequence, and that the radius of the secondary star is ~7-11% larger than expected from standard stellar evolution models. Utilizing the SPOT isochrones that take into account the effect of the inferred starspots and of magnetically-induced inhibition of the convective energy transport, the authors were able to mitigate the radius discrepancy and reproduce the parameters of the secondary for an age of 28 Myr. Thanks to TESS, Frasca et al. (2023) discovered and precisely characterized a benchmark young, totally eclipsing binary system in NGC 2232 with percent-level measurement uncertainties for the stellar masses and sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02368"&gt;Extreme mass ratios and fast rotation in three massive binaries&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Naze et al. 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most massive stars (spectral type OB) exhibit rapid rotation, typically ~200 km/sec, with some Be stars in particular reaching up to 88% of the critical rotational velocity. As rapid stellar rotation directly impacts stellar evolution, in-depth studies of fast early-type rotators can provide important new insight into their origin and characteristics. Naze et al. (2023) present a detailed analysis of three such systems, HD 25631 (spectral type B3V), HD 191495 (spectral type B0V), and HD 46485 (spectral type O7V). The targets were observed by TESS in multiple sectors at both long- and short-cadence, reside in regions of the sky with relatively low contamination, and have lightcurves that exhibit characteristic out-of-eclipse sinusoidal modulations with an amplitude of 10-30 mmag, indicative of a reflection effect. The authors complemented the TESS photometry with spectroscopic observations from multiple instruments at VLT, CFTH, TIGRE, and FUSE. Combining all available data, Naze et al. (2023) discover that all three targets are in fact binary systems with orbital periods of 3-7 days. The primary components have (M = 7-8 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, R = 4-4.4 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, T&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; = 19930 K), (M = 15 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, R = 6.5-7.1 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, T&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; = 28250 K), and (M = 24 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, R = 10-12 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, Teff = 36100 K), for HD 25631, HD 191495, and HD 46485, respectively. The authors note that the secondary stars are much smaller and cooler, with well-constrained masses between 0.8 and 1.8 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt; and radii between ~1.5 and 4 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, and somewhat uncertain effective temperatures in the range of 3400 K to 15000 K. Naze et al. (2023) also argue that the companions are unlikely to be hot subdwarfs as none of them produce detectable UV emission. Instead, the authors suggest that all three systems are young (~20 Myr), pre-interacting OB primaries with pre-Main-Sequence secondaries. Capitalizing on data from TESS, Naze et al. (2023) suggested that the fast rotation observed from HD 25631, HD 191495, and HD 46485 is likely primordial and not the result of previous binary interactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01454"&gt;TOI-4860 b, a short-period giant planet transiting an M3.5 dwarf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Almenara et al. 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large planets in short orbits around small stars provide an important ingredient to our understanding of planet formation and evolution. Recent studies have indicated that these might have a lower occurrence rate compared to Hot Jupiters orbiting Solar-type stars. Almenara et al. (2023) present the discovery and detailed characterization of the newest member of this population, TOI-4860 b. The authors combine TESS data with ground-based photometric and spectroscopic observations from ExTrA, SPIRou, ESPRESSO, and Gaia measurements to confirm that the transits are on-target, constrain the properties of the host star, and measure the planet’s mass.  The analysis of Almenara et al. (2023) show that TOI-4860 is an M3.5 dwarf at a distance of 80 pc with a mass of 0.34 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, radius of 0.35 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, effective temperature of 3255 K, metallicity of [Fe/H] = 0.27 and relatively high proper motion. TESS observed the target in Sectors 10, 36, 46, and 63, and enabled the detection of ~6%-deep transits with a periodicity of 1.52 days. TOI-4860 b has a measured mass of 0.27 M&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt; and radius of 0.7 R&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt; and, at a separation of only 1.8 times the Roche limit, it is close enough to the host star to experience strong tidal interactions. The authors estimate a period change of about 10&lt;sup&gt;-9&lt;/sup&gt; per year and note that this is outside the detection capabilities of current instruments. Almenara et al. (2023) calculate a transmission spectroscopy metric of 180 for TOI-4860 b, making it a high-value target, and note that the radial velocity measurements show potential hints for an additional planet in the system with a period of about 430 days and high eccentricity of ~0.67. The authors argue that the presence of an outer planet could explain the current orbit of TOI-4860 b through Kozai resonance. Data from TESS enabled the discovery of a new giant planet orbiting a small star in a relatively sparse parameter space. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08425"&gt;Analysis of Solar-like X-Class Flare on Wolf 359 Observed Simultaneously with TESS and
XMM-Newton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Pietras et al. 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wolf 359 is one of the closest stars to our Sun (distance of 2.4 pc), and a well-characterized single M-dwarf with a mass of 0.11 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt; and radius of 0.14 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;. It is a highly-variable star with  prominent H-alpha emission and frequent flares. As such, it is a prime target for studying stellar activity in late-type stars and its potential effects on planets around M-dwarfs. Pietras et al. (2023) presented the first analysis of a Sun-like X-class flare on Wolf 359 using data from TESS and XMM-Newton, and studied the physical processes responsible for the event. The target was observed by TESS in Sectors 45 and 46 in short-cadence, and the authors detected a total of 103 flares in the two sectors. The Solar-like flare analyzed here occurred on December 21, 2021, starting at 11:10 UT and ending 12:15 UT, and was also observed by XMM-Newton in the fast mode of the UVM2 filter (bandpass of 182-292 nm). The flare’s time of maximum light was detected at 11:26 UT in the UV bandpass, 11:28 UT in the optical, and 11:33 UT in X-rays. The authors measured a growth time of 24 minutes, followed by 40 minutes of decay time, estimated a total flare energy of 1.1 x 10&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; erg, a maximum observed temperature of 17.25 x 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; K, and a maximum emission measure of 3.5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;. The differential emission measure calculated by Pietras et al. (2023) shows three distinct components with respective temperatures of about 3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; K, 7 x 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; K, and 16-17 x 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; K. From the helium-like  O VII triplet line ratio, the authors determined plasma electron density of 5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;, noting that it is more than an order of magnitude lower than the estimated average density of the flare loop, and argued that the discrepancy is likely due to the accumulation time for the spectra. Based on the TESS and XMM-Newton observations, Pietras et al. (2023) conclude that the processes and mechanisms responsible for stellar flares are consistent with those producing solar flares, and that the geometrical properties of the phenomenon are comparable to similar events occurring on the Sun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11815"&gt;Four years of Type Ia Supernovae Observed by TESS: Early Time Light Curve Shapes and Constraints on Companion Interaction Models&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Fausnaugh et al. 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observations of early time lightcurves of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) are critical for better understanding the inner workings of these spectacular astrophysical phenomena, from the nature of their progenitors to the explosion mechanism and its aftermath. Large-scale photometric surveys can enable such observations and TESS is ideally-suited to monitor a large number of bright Supernovae. Fausnaugh et al. (2023) present an analysis of SNe Ia  observed by the mission, aimed at studying the morphology of the early time observations and evaluating potential signatures of companion interactions. The authors performed a visual inspection of 50 Sectors of TESS data from the first four years of the mission, searching for the 850  SNe Ia known to have occurred during this time and  identifying 307 lightcurves which exhibited a clear SN Ia  rise following a relatively flat pre-explosion baseline. The remaining 543 targets are either too faint to produce the desired signal in TESS, or the explosion occurred before/after the TESS observations. Utilizing comprehensive numerical simulations, Fausnaugh et al. (2023) further constrain the number of targets amenable to reliable measurements of the corresponding power-law index and time of first light to 74 SNe Ia. The rest are excluded from the author’s statistical analysis due to the insufficient signal-to-noise ratio of the TESS lightcurve. For the 74 targets, Fausnaugh et al. (2023) measure an average power-law index of 1.93+/-0.57 and a corresponding average rise time of 15.7+/-3.1 days. The former is consistent with a two-component distribution – a normal distribution with a mean of 2.29 and standard deviation of 0.34, and a long tail with a power-law index smaller than 1. Fausnaugh et al. (2023) argue that this may represent either two underlying SN Ia populations, or a particular range of SN Ia  parameters and environmental factors. The average rise time is consistent with a Gaussian distribution with a mean of 15.89 days and a standard deviation of 3.82 days; it is shortest for SN2019gqv (8.4 days) while longest for SN2020bqr (22.9 days). The authors note that the models for SN2020abqu, SN2021ahmz, and SN2022ajw show a slight preference for the presence of a companion, while the models for SN2020tld and SN2022eyw disfavor this scenario. The exquisite photometry from TESS enabled the rare opportunity to study in-depth the early time observations for a large number of Type Ia SNe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Detailed investigations of stellar clusters (both globular and open) enable key insights into star formation and galaxy evolution, and provide vital information on the processes responsible for stellar variability. As resolving all individual members of distant clusters is practically impossible,  determining their properties depends on integrated light methods providing reliable measurements with realistic uncertainties. Wainer et al. (2023) present results from an investigation of the TESS lightcurves of stellar clusters containing high-amplitude stellar variables (Cepheid and RR Lyrae stars). The authors developed a new, publicly-available pipeline (https://elk.readthedocs.io/) designed for extracting the integrated light of star clusters in the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds, and provide a corresponding lightcurve catalogs of several clusters. Wainer et al. (2023) selected their targets such that the respective cluster is larger than one TESS pixel, its radius is smaller than 0.25 degrees, and the corresponding stellar population is resolved. Altogether, the authors studied 348 clusters – 124 in the Milky Way, 106 in the Small Magellanic Cloud, and 118 in the Large Magellanic Cloud – observed by TESS in Sectors 1-39. Wainer et al. (2023) extracted a total of 2024 per-sector Full-Frame Image integrated lightcurves, and delivered them to MAST as High-Level Science Products. The authors confirmed that the stellar variability of individual stars – both high- and low-amplitude – is preserved in the integrated lightcurves. This highlights the potential of TESS observations to enable detailed astrophysical investigations of stellar clusters in the distant Universe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blue straggler stars (BSS) are dwarfs that are bluer and brighter than the host cluster’s main-sequence turn-off point. Their origin is typically associated with binary mergers or mass transfer, and as such are prime targets for studying formation and evolution of stellar multiples. Vernekar et al. (2023) present a detailed search for close companions to five BSS -- WOCS 1007, 4006, 4003, 5005, and 1025. The targets are confirmed spectroscopic binaries with orbital periods between 0.4 and ~4,900 days and reside in the rich, old, dynamically-active open cluster M67. The authors combine data from NASA's TESS and K2 missions with the PHOEBE package to analyze and model the photometric variability of the targets and constrain their orbital and physical parameters. TESS observed M67 in Sectors 44, 45, and 46, and two of the targets (WOCS 1007 and 4006) were observed in short-cadence; both targets are also identified as delta Scuti pulsators. For WOCS 1007, Vernekar et al. (2023) measure an orbital period of 4.2 days with eccentricity of 0.2 and identify the primary as a B9V star and the secondary as a low-mass white dwarf. They measure stellar masses of 1.95 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt; and 0.22 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, radii of 2.54 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt; and R = 0.078 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, and effective temperatures of 7,600 K and 14,300 K for the primary and secondary components, respectively. The authors detect clear delta Scuti pulsations and ellipsoidal variability (i.e., tidal distortion of the star from its close companion) in WOCS 1007 and note that a prominent 5.5/day peak in the frequency spectrum of the TESS lightcurve is due to contamination from a field source separated by 53 arcsec.  Utilizing TESS data, Vernekar et al. (2023) were able to provide additional evidence supporting the mass-transfer pathway for the formation of the WOCS 1007 system which results in the formation of a close binary containing a low-mass white dwarf companion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01873"&gt;K2 &amp;amp; TESS observations of symbiotic X-ray binaries: GX 1+4 and IGR J16194-2810&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Luna 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symbiotic systems are binary stars composed of a compact object accreting from a red giant. When the compact object is a neutron star, the systems are known as symbiotic X-ray binaries, of which about a dozen are known at the time of writing. Luna (2023) presents a detailed analysis of two such systems, GX1+4 and IGR J16194-2810, the latter of which was observed by TESS in Sectors 12 and 39. Based on optical and X-ray spectroscopy, the giant component of IGR J16194-2810 was identified as a spectral type M2 III red giant. Previous observations found no evidence for pulsations of the neutron star (potentially due to unfavorable geometric configuration) and, prior to TESS, its spin period was unknown.  To address this issue, Luna (2023) divides the TESS lightcurve of the target into three segments and searches for significant periodicity in each of them with a Generalized Lomb-Scargle algorithm. The author detects a prominent peak at 242.839 minutes as well as the corresponding first harmonic in the power spectrum of the first two data segments (Sector 12, MJD &amp;lt; 58640.43 and 58643.97 &amp;lt; MJD &amp;lt; 58652.37), which they associate with the spin period of the neutron star component of IGR J16194-2810. Luna (2023) argues that the measured periodicity and the X-ray luminosity of the target (10&lt;sup&gt;34-35&lt;/sup&gt; erg/sec) are consistent with model predictions. With that said, the author notes that the 242.839 minutes periodicity is likely transient, since the peak is not present in the power spectrum for Sector 39 (MJD &amp;gt; 59363.64), despite the fact that neither the optical nor the X-ray luminosity of the targets seem to have changed significantly between the two epochs (May 2019 vs May 2021). Thanks to TESS, IGR J16194-2810 is only the second symbiotic X-ray system with a measured spin period of the neutron star component. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05368"&gt;TESS discovers a super-Earth orbiting the M dwarf star TOI-1680&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Ghachoui et al. 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TOI-1680 is a faint (V = 15.87 mag), nearby (37 parsecs) M dwarf residing near the continuous viewing zone of the JWST. Ghachoui et al. (2023) present the discovery, validation, and characterization of the transiting super-Earth TOI-1680 b. TOI-1680 was observed by TESS in 19 sectors in short-cadence, which the authors combined with complementary multi-wavelength photometric, spectroscopic and direct-imaging observations from TRAPPIST, SPECULOOS, LCO, Keck, IRTF, and Shane. The authors classify the host star as an M4.5 dwarf with a mass of 0.18 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, radius of 0.2 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, effective temperature of about 3,200 K, and a metallicity of either 0.04±0.2 (based on the Shane/Kast data) or −0.32±0.13 (based on IRTF/SpeX). Additionally, their analysis of the TESS lightcurve and of the archival ASAS-SN photometry show no indications of rotational variability or significant stellar activity. The authors note that this is consistent with the non-detection of Hα emission in the target’s optical spectrum, and indicates that TOI-1680 is overall inactive. Ghachoui et al. (2023) performed a joint analysis of all available data, including statistical validation with the TRICERATOPS package, to measure a planetary radius of 1.47 R&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;, orbital period of 4.8 days, and, assuming albedo value of zero and perfect heat redistribution, equilibrium temperature of 404 K. The authors note that, for a circular orbit and expected mass of about 3.2 M&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;, TOI-1680 b would be a potential target for mass measurements through high-precision radial-velocity observations and argue that an 8-m class telescope should be able to achieve a 5-sigma precision in about 29 hours. In turn, such measurements would make the planet a suitable target for atmospheric characterization with JWST/NIRSpec. TOI-1680 b is the latest addition to the important population of planets larger than Earth and smaller than Neptune.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09769"&gt;Solar-like oscillations in Gamma Cephei A as seen through SONG and TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Knudstrup et al. 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gamma Cephei is a bright (V = 3.2 mag), nearby (~14 pc) binary system with an orbital period of ~67 years. The primary, Gamma Cephei A, was one of the first stars announced to host an exoplanet (Gamma Cephei Ab, Campbell et al. 1988), which was confirmed 15 years later (Hatzes et al. 2003). Subsequent analysis showed that the planet follows a highly inclined orbit with respect to the binary system. Knudstrup et al. (2023) present an in-depth asteroseismic and orbital analysis of the system aimed at providing a better understanding of its formation and evolution. The authors combine 2-min cadence TESS lightcurves from Sectors 18, 24, 25, and 52 with observations from the SONG network, the Nordic Optical Telescope, and Gaia DR3 data to detect Solar-like oscillations in the red giant primary Gamma Cephei A, and create a combined power spectrum. Knudstrup et al. (2023) use the BASTA framework and detect multiple radial and quadruple modes, as well as a number of mixed dipole moments, and even a potential signal with a period of 50 days. The authors investigate the latter with the assumption that it is due to rotation and note that, if real, it would be consistent with ~13 degrees of stellar inclination – implying that the star and the planet should be either aligned or anti-aligned. Knudstrup et al. (2023) obtain both global seismic parameters, and combine the detected frequencies with the effective temperature, log g, metallicity, and luminosity to derive primary mass of 1.27 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, primary radius of 4.74 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, and age of 5.7 Gyr. Utilizing the measured radial velocities, the authors also derive a mass of 0.33 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt; for the secondary star (Gamma Cephei B) and 6.6 M&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt; for the planet (Gamma Cephei Ab). Thanks to TESS data, Knudstrup et al. (2023) were able to refine the physical and orbital parameters of the Gamma Cephei binary star, one of the first exoplanet host systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08551"&gt;The unexpected optical and ultraviolet variability of the standard star α Sex (HD 87887&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Monier et al. 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alpha Sextantis is a bright standard star (V = 4.5 mag) at a distance of about 86 parsecs and a known variable, with a spectral type of A0III and effective temperature of Teff ~ 10,000 K. Observations from the International Ultraviolet Explorer from 1992 show significant variability both in the mid-UV and in the far-UV regime, as well as in the V-band. As such, it is a prime target for further studies aimed at determining the origin and properties of the detected variability and TESS is ideally-suited to provide the needed observations. Indeed, Monier et al. (2023) scrutinized the 2-min cadence TESS data for potential pulsation signatures. The authors analyzed each of the three Sectors separately (8, 35, and 45) in order to avoid potential issues associated with the properties of the spectral window with respect to the combined lightcurve. Utilizing a discrete Fourier Transform, Monier et al. (2023) detect a clear, dominant frequency of 2.62/day (period of ~9.1 hours) with an amplitude of about 0.3 mmag in all three sectors, along with indications for multiperiodic pulsations in Sector 45 with an amplitude of up to 0.3 mmag and covering a frequency range between 1.8/day and 5.3/day. Capitalizing on archival data from NARVAL, the authors estimate the fundamental properties of Alpha Sextantis as follows: mass M = 2.5 +/- 0.32 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, R = 3.07 +/- 0.9 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, mean density of 0.13 +/- 0.11 g/cm3, Age = 385+/-77 Myr, and luminosity L = 90+/-52 L&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;. Monier et al. (2023) also note that the measured parallax from Gaia should be interpreted with caution given the star is bright, part of a binary system, and the measured astrometric excess noise is ~2 mas. The authors estimate an expected period of fundamental radial pressure mode of P = 9.3+/-4.1 hours, consistent with the measurements. Utilizing TESS data, Monier et al. (2023) were able to detect clear periodicity in the lightcurve of the standard star Alpha Sextantis with a period of about 9 hours, which they attribute to low-radial order p-mode pulsations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07627"&gt;Testing Ultra-low Amplitude Cepheid Candidates in the Galactic Disk by TESS and Gaia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Tarczay-Nehéz et al. 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cepheids pulsating at the millimagnitude-level, known as ultra-low amplitude (ULA) Cepheids, are typically considered to be at or near the classical instability strip. Some ULA pulsations in post-AGB stars have been classified as strange modes generally attributed to surface modes that occur at the adiabatic limit and can be also present in classical Cepheids. As a milli-magnitude phenomenon, strange modes are highly challenging to detect and only a few dozen ULA Cepheids in the Milky Way and in the Magellanic Clouds are known. Tarczay-Nehéz et al. (2023) present a detailed investigation of six ULA Cepheids first identified in CoRoT data (CoRoT ID 102835671, 102964858, 102940813, 102838469, 102827671, and 102799143). The authors use TESS FFI lightcurves from Sectors 6 and 33 and archival data, and, despite the fact that the targets are relatively faint (G magnitude between 12.6 and 16), were able to detect low-amplitude variability in four out of the six stars. The corresponding period values obtained from TESS data match those from CoRoT to within 0.001-0.01 days. For the remaining two targets (CoRoT ID 102827671 and 102799143), the combination of high contamination, low signal-to-noise ratio, and for 102799143 the period commensurability with the orbital period of TESS, make robust variability detection highly challenging. Tarczay-Nehéz et al. (2023) assign 102964858 and 102827671 to main-sequence A and K spectral type, and attribute the observed variability to spot-induced rotation. The authors argue that the other four targets are close to the region of slow B pulsators (the blue tip of the Main Sequence) but are likely rotational variables instead of pulsation variables. Additionally, based on the measured times of lightcurve maxima, Tarczay-Nehéz et al. (2023) note that there may be indications for a possible period change in 102838469 with a timescale on the order of 10 years. Capitalizing on TESS data, the authors were able to detect low amplitude variations in four ultra-low amplitude Cepheid candidates – a poorly-understood stellar population – and conclude that none of them reside in the color-magnitude regime of the fundamental or first overtone Cepheids. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04000"&gt;Discovery of a substellar companion in the TESS light curve of the δ Scuti/γ Doradus hybrid pulsator HD 31221&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Kalman et al. 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Substellar companions to A- and F-type stars are rare, with only a handful of known exoplanets and brown dwarfs detected around delta Scuti stars through transit photometry. Such systems are excellent laboratories for constraining the atmospheric properties of the companions through phase curve analysis, as well as for testing models of planet formation and evolution. Kalman et al. (2023) present the discovery of a substellar companion to HD 31221, a relatively bright (V = 8 mag) A2 star observed by TESS in Sectors 43 and 44 at a  2-min cadence. The substellar companion produced nine transits separated by 4.66 days, which the authors confirmed to be on-target. Kalman et al. (2023) combined the TESS lightcurves with photometry from MuSCAT2, speckle interferometry from the SAR telescope, and spectroscopic measurements from TRES to constrain the orbital and physical parameters of the system. The authors classify HD 31221 as a hybrid δ Scuti/γ Doradus pulsator with a mass of about 1.45 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, radius of 1.55 R&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;, and effective temperature of about 7700 K. As the star is a rapid rotator (V&lt;sub&gt;sini&lt;/sub&gt; = 175 km/sec), the detected transits are asymmetric due to gravity darkening. Kalman et al. (2023) model the observed out-of-transit modulations in the lightcurve utilizing Doppler beaming, ellipsoidal and reflection effects. Noting that the lightcurve is dominated by the latter, they estimate the companion's mass to be M = 11.5+/-10.3 M&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt; (based on the ellipsoidal variation), indicating that it is either a brown dwarf of a massive giant planet. The radius of the companion is 1.3 R&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;  and its orbit is misaligned with respect to the spin axis of the host star, such that the obliquity is about -121.6 degrees. Kalman et al. (2023) estimate that the companion's albedo is about 1.58, found an occultation depth of 99+/-9 ppm, and, measuring a 52 degrees offset between the substellar point and the brightest region of the companion's atmosphere, argue that the latter might be cloudy. Thanks to TESS, the authors were able to add a new member to the still-small family of substellar companions to early-type pulsators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02904"&gt;Light Curve Analysis of the AP Dor Binary System using Ground-Based and TESS Observations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Poro et al. 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AP Dor is an overcontact binary system where both components are tidally distorted, have exceeded their respective Roche lobes, and share an envelope with a similar effective temperature. It is a V = 9.3 magnitude W Ursae Majoris-type eclipsing binary with an orbital period of 0.42 days exhibiting a sine-like lightcurve with no sharp eclipses. Poro et al. (2023) present a detailed analysis of the system aimed at constraining its physical and orbital parameters based on twelve sectors of TESS data (1, 4, 6, 8, 10, 13, 27, 30, 31, 32, 34, and 39) and follow-up observations from the HSH telescope. The authors combine all available photometry with Gaia data to model the system with the PHOEBE code and update the ephemeris through MCMC analysis. The authors note that the orbital period of AP Dor is listed in the AAVSO catalog as 0.42 days but 0.21 days in the ASAS3 catalog. They measured a total of 1330 eclipse times, found no significant deviations from a linear ephemeris, and confirmed the period to be 0.42 days. For their analysis, Poro et al. (2023) assumed gravity darkening of 0.32 and bolometric albedos of 0.5 for both components of the binary, extinction coefficient A = 0.035, and tested three different effective temperatures for the primary (6517 K, 6396 K, and 6530 K). The estimated parameters of the system are as follows: the primary/secondary mass, radius, effective temperature, and stellar type are 1.28/0.75 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, 1.36/1.11 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, 6585/6302 K, and F5/F7, respectively. The semi-major axis of the binary is 3.02 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, the inclination is 53 degrees, and the phase shift of the secondary eclipses is 0.006. Poro et al. (2023) note that both the primary and the secondary stars are positioned between the Zero-Age Main Sequence and the Terminal-Age Main Equation region of the HR diagram, measure an angular orbital momentum of the system 51.85 and estimate a fill-out factor of 48.8%, firmly placing it in the regime of overcontact binaries. TESS data enabled a detailed analysis of AP Dor that helped confirm the orbital period and classification of the system, and refine its properties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05246"&gt;ZZ Ceti stars of the southern ecliptic hemisphere re-observed by TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Bognar et al. 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZZ Ceti stars (also known as DAV) represent the most common type of pulsating White Dwarfs (WDs), with typical periods of 100-1,500 sec and amplitudes of about 0.1%. While the range of effective temperatures of these stars is relatively narrow (~10,500 to ~13,000 K), the produced pulsations are rather diverse. For example, the outbursts produced by cool DAVs can be irregular and are often difficult to predict. Bognar et al. (2023) present the results from a detailed study of 13 southern ZZ Ceti stars observed by TESS in two separate epochs. The targets are relatively faint (typical G ~ 14-15 mag), were first observed in Cycle 1 with a 2-min cadence (results reported in a previous paper), and then again in Cycle 3 and 4 with a  20-sec cadence. The authors found that four of the thirteen targets do not exhibit significant pulsation frequencies. For the remaining nine targets, Bognar et al. (2023) compared the corresponding pulsation behaviors between the two epochs (Cycle 1 vs Cycle 3+4) utilizing a Fourier analysis and performed an astroseismological analysis with the WD Evolution Code. Seven of the nine targets show clear pulsation frequencies -- Ross 548, EC 23487-2424, BPM 31594, BPM 30551, MCT 0145-2211, L 19-2, and HS 1013+0321, some of which are possible new detections. The results from the asteroseismological analysis are consistent with the distances measured from Gaia. Of the remaining two, HE 0532-5605 exhibits brightening episodes consistent with a recurring phenomenon, leading the authors to suggest that it is a new outbursting ZZ Ceti star near the red edge. The observed brightening of the other target, WD J0925+0509 is a false positive caused by a foreground Solar System object crossing the field of view. TESS data was critical for improving the measured parameters of the examined systems and demonstrated the high value of short-cadence observations to the study of WDs in general, and ZZ Ceti pulsators in particular. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14743"&gt;Rotation and activity in late-type members of the young cluster ASCC 123&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Frasca et al. 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASCC 123 is a young open cluster at a distance of ~240 pc, an age of ~100-200 Myr, E(B − V ) ~ 0.1, and a chemical composition consistent with the local Galactic trend. It was discovered in 2005 and to date contains a few dozen potential cluster members. Frasca et al. (2023) utilized data from TESS, the Osservatorio Astrofisico di Catania, and HARPS to investigate 55 stars in ASCC 123. TESS observed the targets in Sector 16 and 17, and the authors used the corresponding long-cadence SAP/PDCSAP and PATHOS lightcurves. Frasca et al. (2023) measured rotation periods and variation amplitudes for 29 of their 55 targets, and detected a transiting planet candidate around one target. The authors find no clear correlation between the measured rotation periods and amplitudes and infer a gyrochronological age comparable to that of the Pleiades by comparing the corresponding distributions to the color-index. Additionally, Frasca et al. (2023) derive obliquities for 7 targets in their sample covered by spectroscopic observations and, with the caveat that the sample is small, find no compelling evidence for preferred orientation. Based on the respective magnetic activity, the authors note that these 7 stars follow the typical trends for flux-flux diagrams of FGKM stars. Capitalizing on TESS data, Frasca et al. (2023) obtain important new insight into the properties of a relatively-poorly studied young dispersed cluster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06655"&gt;TOI-733 b: a planet in the small-planet radius valley orbiting a Sun-like star&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Georgieva et al. 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TOI-733 is a relatively bright (T&lt;sub&gt;mag&lt;/sub&gt; = 8.8), nearby (~75 pc) Sun-like star with an age of ~4.4 Gyr. Observed by TESS in Sectors 9 and 36, its lightcurve shows periodic transit-like signals suggesting the presence of a transiting planet. Georgieva et al. (2023) present the discovery and characterization of this planet, TOI-733 b, as part of the KESPRINT program and based on data from TESS, LCOGT, PEST, HARPS, and Gemini. The authors perform a joint modeling of the photometric and spectroscopic data utilizing Gaussian processes to derive the physical and orbital parameters of the system. Their analysis shows that the planet has an orbital period of 4.88 days, radius of 1.99 R&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;, mass of 5.72 M&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;, bulk density of 3.98 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and slight orbital eccentricity (~0.05). With such a short orbital period, the planet receives ~207 times more incoming stellar flux than the Earth and has an estimated equilibrium temperature of 1055 K. TOI-733 is nearly identical to our  Sun, with a radius of 0.95 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, mass 0.96 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, T&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; = 5585 K, [Fe/H]= −0.04+/-0.05, a rotation period of 25.48 days, and a spectral type G6 V. TOI-733 b resides in the transition regime between rocky and volatile-rich planets and, thanks to TESS, provides deeper insight into planet formation and evolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14627"&gt;Revealing the Binarity of HD 36030 -- One of the Hottest Flare Stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Maryeva et al. 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HD 36030 is a B9V star and member of the ASCC 21 open cluster. With an effective temperature of ~12,000 K it is one of the hottest B-type flaring stars and thus a prime target for studying the still-elusive mechanism responsible for the flaring activity of early-type stars. To investigate HD 36030, Maryeva et al. (2023) combined TESS data with follow-up photometry from FRAM-ORM and high-resolution spectroscopy from the Perek 2-m telescopes, as well as archival photometry from Mini-MegaTORTORA. TESS observed the target at a cadence of 30-min in Sector 6 and 10-min in Sector 32 .The lightcurves from both sectors show prominent oscillations, as well as one flare in Sector 6 (with an ~0.6% amplitude) and another in Sector 32 (with an amplitude of ~0.2%). Maryeva et al. (2023) find no coherent periodicity in the photometric variability and measure flare energies of 2.2x10&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt; erg (Sector 6) and 6.1x10&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt; erg (Sector 32). The authors detect clear RV modulations in the spectrum of HD 36030, with a scatter of up to 45 km/sec, and argue that it is in fact a binary system with a period shorter than 8 days. They do not detect lines from the secondary component and thus identify the system as an SB1. Maryeva et al. (2023) note that it is unlikely for the assumed late-type binary companion to HD 36030 to produce such highly-energetic flares, and argue that the B9V primary shows no clear signs of surface magnetic activity or unusual spectral features. Thanks to data from TESS, the authors attribute the observed flares to interactions between the two components of the binary system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14275"&gt;TIC 219006972: A Compact, Coplanar Quadruple Star System Consisting of Two Eclipsing Binaries with an Outer Period of 168 days&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Kostov et al. 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quadruple stellar system is a gravitationally-bound system of four stars orbiting around a common center of mass. These systems provide deeper understanding of how multiple stars form and evolve, and are particularly interesting when the orbits are compact enough for the various components to interact on observable timescales. Kostov et al. (2023) present the discovery and confirmation of a new quadruple system, TIC 219006972, consisting of two eclipsing binaries in a hierarchical 2+2+ configuration. The authors used TESS Full-Frame Image data to identify two sets of eclipses following two different orbital periods, 8.3 days and 13.7 days, and detect prominent eclipse time variations in both eclipsing binaries. Kostov et al. (2023) employ a comprehensive photometric-dynamical analysis to model the orbital and physical parameters of TIC 219006972, and find that the system has an outer orbital period of only 168 days, a factor of two shorter than the previous record holder VW LMi. The component stars of TIC 219006972 have masses between 0.48 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt; and 0.98 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, radii between 0.45 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt; and 1.13 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;. The system is nearly edge-on (the mutual orbital inclination between the two eclipsing binaries is about 1 degree), has an age of about 6 Gyr, and is long-term dynamically stable. TIC 219006972 is the latest demonstration of the discovery potential of TESS for multiple star systems and raises the interesting question of whether there are quadruple systems with even shorter outer orbital periods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05706"&gt;Contamination in TESS light curves: The case of the Fast Yellow Pulsating Supergiants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Pederson &amp;amp; Bell 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast yellow pulsating supergiants (FYPS) are a recently-proposed new class of pulsators that oscillate on typical timescales of about a day. These are prime targets for studies of the formation, structure and evolution of massive stars, and TESS data provides an excellent opportunity to pursue such studies. Pederson &amp;amp; Bell (2023) present a detailed case study of TESS pixel data for 17 FYPS from the Large and Small Magellanic clouds, determining the source of the detected signals and paying close attention to potential sources of contamination. The authors were able to reproduce the detected signals for 14 of the 17 FYPS and identify the source of the signals for 4 targets -- HD 269953, HD 268687, HD 269840, and BZ Tuc. Pederson &amp;amp; Bell (2023) find that the detected signals are on-target only for BZ Tuc while the other three signals are consistent with false positives caused by contamination from nearby sources. Furthermore, even for the case of BZ Tuc the authors argue that the signals are likely due to data processing systematics rather than astrophysics, introduced during the removal process of the Cepheid variability from the SAP lightcurve. Thus Pederson &amp;amp; Bell (2023) caution that careful evaluation of FYPS source confusion is needed before this proposed new class of pulsators is firmly established.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02139"&gt;Three long period transiting giant planets from TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Brahm et al. 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longer the period of a transiting planet, the smaller the number of transits that can be detected when the observing baseline is limited. Even a single detected transit, however, makes a target worthy of further investigation and TESS provides a large number of such targets. For example, as an all-sky survey, the mission enables the systematic analysis of transiting warm Jupiters bright enough for detailed follow-up studies. Brahm et al. (2023) present the discovery and characterization of three new warm Jupiters, TOI 4406b, TOI 2338b, and TOI 2589b. All three planets were initially detected as single transits in TESS Full-Frame Image data in Cycle 1, suggesting potential warm Jupiter candidates, and were subsequently observed in short-cadence in Cycle 3 where they produced additional transits. The authors combine the TESS lightcurves with ground-based photometry from LCO, high-contrast imaging from SOAR, and spectroscopic observations from FEROS, HARPS, CORALIE, and CHIRON, to model the orbital and physical properties of the three systems. Brahm et al. (2023) find that TOI 4406b has a radius of 1 R&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;, mass of 0.3 M&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;, orbital period of 30 days, slight eccentricity (0.15), and age of 2.9 Gyr; TOI 2338b has a radius of 1 R&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;, mass of 6 M&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;, orbital period of 22.6 days, eccentricity of 0.68 and age of 7 Gyr; TOI 2589b has a radius of 1.1 R&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;, mass of 3.5 M&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;, orbital period of 61.6 days, eccentricity of 0.52, and age of 11 Gyr. The latter is one of the top five longest-period confirmed planets detected by TESS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citizen science increases public engagement in cutting-edge exoplanet research, promotes science education and appreciation, and accelerates scientific data analysis. A key area where volunteers provide vital contribution to the field of exoplanets is vetting. Vetting is the process of ruling out potential false positive scenarios that can mimic planetary signals caused by e.g. variable stars, eclipsing binary systems, instrument artifacts. Magliano et al. (2023) present a new catalog of uniformly-vetted exoplanet candidates discovered in TESS data. The authors perform a comprehensive analysis of 999 TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs) by combining the automated vetting pipeline DAVE with the power of citizen science as represented by the Planet Patrol project. The authors test for common sources of false positives such as photocenter offset during transits, presence of secondary eclipses, odd-even differences between consecutive transits, lightcurve modulations synchronized with the orbital period, nearby bright field stars, etc. Magliano et al. (2023) also developed an automated disposition generator designed to quantitatively assess human inspection and analysis. Of the 999 TOIs, the authors identify 752 genuine planet candidates, 142 false positives, and 105 as potential false positives. This work highlights the exoplanet discovery capability of TESS and provides a set of benchmark TOIs appropriate for follow-up confirmation efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12205"&gt;Asteroseismic age constraints on the open cluster NGC 2477 using oscillating stars identified with TESS FFI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Palakkatharappil &amp;amp; Creevey 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A star's age is one of the fundamental properties underlying our understanding of stellar astrophysics. Deriving precise stellar ages is challenging, and typically relies on isochrone fitting or asteroseismic measurements. The two methods can be combined by examining pulsating stars in open clusters where the stars are assumed to be of the same age. Palakkatharappil &amp;amp; Creevey (2023) present a detailed study of stellar pulsations in NGC 2477 using TESS photometry, spectroscopic observations, Gaia data, and extinction maps. NGC 2477 is an intermediate-age (previous estimates ranging between 0.7 and 1.5 Ga) open cluster in the Puppis constellation with a differential reddening E(B-V) ~ 0.2-0.4 mag, mean radial velocity of ~7.3 km/sec, distance of ~1,200-1,500 pc, and an estimated metallicity between -0.24 and 0.18. TESS observed NGC 2477 in Sectors 7, 8, 34, and 35 in Full-Frame Image mode. Palakkatharappil &amp;amp; Creevey (2023) examined 2039 cluster members and used Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis to detect 185 oscillating stars and 13 binaries. Given the high stellar density of NGC 2477, especially towards the center, the authors considered only 16 oscillating stars where the contamination is low. Combining TESS data with theoretical models, the authors were able to estimate an age of 1.0+/-0.1 Ga, E(B-V) = 0.29+/-0.05, metallicity of 0.1+/-0.05 dex, and a distance of 1444+/-81 pc.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15962"&gt;Exploring the internal rotation of the extremely low-mass He-core white dwarf GD 278 with TESS asteroseismology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Calcaferro et al. 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-mass stars in a close binary system may evolve into extremely low-mass (ELM) He-core white dwarfs due to extensive mass loss. ELMs have typical masses of M &amp;lt; 0.18-0.2 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, can exhibit complex brightness variations, and their progenitors may experience multiple H-shell flashes. Calcaferro et al. (2023) present the first asteroseismological analysis of GD 278, a pulsating ELM white dwarf, and probe its internal rotation based on the measured rotational splittings. GD 278 resides in a single-lined spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of 4.61 hours, has a mass of M = 0.191 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, effective temperature of Teff = 9230 K, gravity of log(g) = 6.627, and pulsates with periods ranging from 2290 to 6730 sec. The authors combine TESS data with observations from the Otto Struve telescope, LPCODE and MESA stellar evolutionary models to compare the observed rotational frequency splittings to the theoretical expectations, assuming a rigid body rotational profile. Calcaferro et al. (2023) find that the asteroseismological profile of GD 278 is consistent with rigid-body rotation, and the derived rotation period is typical for white dwarfs and pre-white dwarfs. Rotation in ELMs has been proposed as a potential explanation for the observed pulsations in pre-ELM white dwarfs, and for the observed surface composition of ELMs containing heavy metals. TESS data helped the authors test the theoretical predictions for the frequency splittings.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07319"&gt;Observations of GRB 230307A by TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Fausnaugh et al. 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gamma-ray bursts (GRB) are extremely energetic events that can be hundreds of times brighter than a typical supernova. They are usually associated with either the final evolutionary stages of massive stars (long-duration GRBs) or neutron star/black hole mergers (short-duration GRBs). GRB 230307A is a long GRB detected by Fermi on 2023 March 7, followed by an optical afterglow observed by ULTRACAM, GMOS-S, RASA36, and KMTnet. Fausnaugh et al. (2023) present the TESS observations and analysis of the afterglow based on the 200-sec cadence lightcurve from Sector 62. The GRB data was made publicly-available on MAST as a high-level science product produced by MIT on 2023 March 12, less than two days after it was downloaded from the spacecraft. The authors utilize their difference-imaging pipeline to process the photometry and identify a transient source close to the target identified by Fermi. Their lightcurve is available &lt;a href="https://tess.mit.edu/public/tesstransients/light_curves/lc_grb230307A_cleaned.txt"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Fausnaugh et al. (2023) fit to the afterglow lightcurve a fast-rise exponential decay and a double power-law model. From this fit several parameters were derived: a peak afterglow magnitude of Tmag = 17.65, a rise time of 0.057 days, time of break of 0.09 days after the Fermi trigger, &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.6+/-0.2, and &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = -0.21+/-0.07. They also estimate a peak burst magnitude brighter than Tmag = 13.4 for duration of less than 73.6 sec, and an isotropic luminosity at 7839 Angstrom greater than 9x10&lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt; (D/1 Gpc)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; erg/sec. Thanks to TESS data, the authors were able to follow-up and study the behavior of the GRB just a few days after the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12087"&gt;TESS observations of the Pleiades cluster: a nursery for delta Scuti stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Bedding et al. 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delta Scuti stars are young pulsating variables residing in the instability strip of the HR diagram. Not all stars in the strip show delta Scuti pulsations, and making a comprehensive description of the mechanisms responsible for these pulsations is challenging. Bedding et al. (2023) present a detailed analysis of 89 A- and F-type probable members of the Pleiades open cluster using TESS photometry, Gaia data, and spectroscopic measurements from the TRES instrument. TESS observed the Pleiades in Sectors 42-44, with 87 out of the 89 examined stars observed in 120-s cadence. The authors detected delta Scuti pulsations from 36 stars in the TESS photometry, 6 of which are previously known pulsators, and measured rotational velocities for 49 stars in their sample. Bedding et al. (2023) found that the delta Scuti pulsators reside within a strip constrained to Gaia colors 0.1 &amp;lt; G&lt;sub&gt;BP&lt;/sub&gt; − GRP&lt;sub&gt;RP&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 0.55. The fraction of pulsating stars from their sample in this color range is 72%, increasing to 84% in the middle of the instability strip (0.2 &amp;lt; GM&lt;sub&gt;BP&lt;/sub&gt; − GRP&lt;sub&gt;RP&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 0.4). The authors note that this is significantly higher than the corresponding fraction of delta Scuti stars detected in Kepler data (50-60%), and argue that the details of the pulsation spectra do not seem to correlate with effective temperature. This work demonstrated TESS' ability to make major contributions to the field of variable stars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00659"&gt;The occurrence rate of giant planets orbiting low-mass stars with TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Bryant et al. 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estimates of the occurrence frequency of giant planets around low-mass stars provide important tests for the theories of planet formation and evolution. The core-accretion pathway, for example, predicts such planets to be rare, with occurrence rate estimates typically less than 1%. Bryant et al. (2023) present a systematic study of the occurrence rate of planets with radii between 0.6 R&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt; and 2 R&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt; around stars with masses between 0.088 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt; and 0.71 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, and distances of less than 100 pc. The authors use 30-min cadence TESS data from Sectors 1-26 to perform a transit search on 91,306 low-mass stars, detecting a total of 3930 periodic transit-like signals. Of these, they flag 1828 as false positives and mark the remaining 2102 as genuine planet candidates. From the latter, Bryant et al. (2023) identify 15 giant planet candidates, of which five are confirmed planets and one is a spectroscopically-determined eclipsing binary, leaving a total of nine bona-fide giant planet candidates around low-mass stars. To measure the detection efficiency of their pipeline, the authors perform injection-and-retrieval simulations of 873,760 for a period between 1 and 10 days, planet radii between 0.6 R&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt; and 2 R&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;, and impact parameters between 0 and 1. Thanks to the TESS data, Bryant et al. (2023) were able to measure an occurrence frequency of giant planets around low-mass stars of 0.194+/-0.072%, extending the estimates to stars of lower mass compared to previous studies, and suggesting that these planets are even rarer around late M-dwarf compared to early M-dwarfs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04535"&gt;Temporal albedo variability in the phase curve of KELT-1b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Parviainen 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KELT-1b is a highly-irradiated transiting brown dwarf with an orbital period of 1.2 days producing prominent secondary eclipses as well as ellipsoidal modulations and Doppler beaming. Previously, ground-based, Spitzer and CHEOPS observations have been used to estimate a dayside brightness temperature of about 2,900 K. TESS photometry from Sector 17 has, however, indicated a much brighter than expected dayside, in disagreement with the Spitzer and CHEOPS measurements after taking into account the passband differences. Parviainen (2023) combines TESS data from Sectors 17 and 57 to address this discrepancy. The author models the phase curve of KELT-1b and shows that the dayside brightness varies between the two TESS visits. Specifically, the dayside flux ratio changes from 6.1+/-0.9 % for Sector 17 to 1.3+/-0.7% for Sector 57, and the eclipse depth changes from 360+/-50 ppm for Sector 17 to 74+/-42 for Sector 57. Parviainen (2023) notes that the timescales of the observed variability are likely long and argues that the discrepancies between TESS, Spitzer, CHEOPS and ground-based observations are most likely due to variations in the brown dwarf's cloud cover. Thanks to TESS data, the author was able to offer a potential solution to a long-standing issue with the dayside brightness of KELT-1b. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09249"&gt;Starspot mapping with adaptive parallel tempering. II. Application to TESS data for M-dwarf flare stars, AU Microscopii, YZ Canis Minoris, and EV Lacertae&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Ikita et al. 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AU Microscopii (AU Mic), YZ Canis Minoris (YZ CMi), and EV Lacertae (EV Lac) are magnetically-active M-dwarfs producing frequent flares and exhibiting prominent photometric variability. AU Mic is also a host to a resolved debris disk and two warm Neptunes, and its surface is likely spotted. Zeeman Doppler imaging has indicated the presence of polar spots on YZ CMi and EV Lac. However, the stellar surfaces of the three stars cannot be directly resolved, and thus the exact location of the starspots is not well known. To study the connection between starspots and stellar flares for these three M dwarfs, Ikita et al. (2023) use 2-min TESS data from Cycles 1, 2, and 3. From the observed photometric variability, the authors measure rotation periods of about 4.8 days for AU Mic, 2.8 days for YZ Cmi, and 4.4 days for EV Lac. Ikita et al. (2023) perform starspot modeling and suggest that the rotation phase is not strictly correlated to the flare rate, indicating that flares can occur at any rotation phase. Capitalizing on TESS data, they note that while the flare rate for AU Mic and YZ CMi has not changed significantly during the TESS observations, both the shape and the amplitude of the corresponding lightcurve variability do change with time. The authors attribute this to variations in the spot size and location on the stellar surface. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10189"&gt;FluxCT: A Web Tool for Identifying Contaminating Flux in Kepler and TESS Target Pixel Files&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Schonhut-Stasik &amp;amp; Stassun 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flux contamination is a known issue when analyzing photometric time-series observations. Depending on how crowded the field of view is and how large the pixels are, it can be anywhere from a nuisance to a serious issue. In the latter case, flux contamination may result in inaccurate results, persistent false positives, and even hamper new discoveries. Schonhut-Stasik &amp;amp; Stassun (2023) present a new tool, FluxCT, designed to address this issue by using the TESS target's pixel aperture and Gaia database. The tool queries the latter for potentially contaminating sources using a unique search polygon for each target. Using only the target ID as input, FluxCT creates a plot containing the nearby resolved sources, highlighting the corresponding magnitude differences, flux ratios and total contaminated flux, and also the Renormalized Unit Weight Error (RUWE) as measured from Gaia. The authors tested their tool on 147 Kepler stars exhibiting lightcurve oscillations and compared the results to those from a standard cone search with a radius of 4 arcsec. Schonhut-Stasik &amp;amp; Stassun (2023) found that while the latter identified 23 contaminating sources, FluxCT identified 107, and argued that the FluxCT provides a better representation of the flux contamination. FluxCT is freely-available as a web-based tool. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10858"&gt;The Benchmark M Dwarf Eclipsing Binary CM Draconis With TESS: Spots, Flares and Ultra-Precise Parameters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Martin et al. 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CM Draconis is an eclipsing double-lined spectroscopic binary star composed of two nearly-identical M dwarfs on a nearly edge-on orbit. The component stars are fully convective, orbit each other every 1.26 days, produce 50%-deep eclipses, and have a bound tertiary component (a white dwarf) separated by at least 370 AU. Previous measurements on the masses and sizes of the two M dwarfs reach precisions of better than 1%. Martin et al. (2023) use TESS data to place more than an order of magnitude stronger constraints on the masses and sizes. The authors utilize 12 sectors of short-cadence photometry obtained during Cycles 2, 4, and 5, and archival radial velocity measurements to derive stellar radii with 0.06% precision and masses with 0.12% precision. Additionally, Martin et at. (2023) identified prominent out-of-eclipse modulations, indicating the presence of spots on one or both stars, and noted that the activity cycle of CM Dra may be similar to that of the Sun. The authors detected 125 flares, measured flare rate at about 0.5 flares per day, and found no correlation between the flares and orbital phase. Thanks to TESS, Martin et al. (2023) were able to solidify the component stars of CM Dra as the two most precisely characterized M dwarfs at the time of writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13521"&gt;V994 Her: A Unique Triply Eclipsing Sextuple Star System&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Zasche et al. 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V994 Herculis was identified as a quadruple star system composed of two eclipsing binaries more than a decade ago, the first of its kind at the time. As a relatively bright target (V = 6.96 mag), it is a well-studied and characterized system consisting of two massive binaries with orbital periods of 1.42 days and 2.08 days. Zasche et al. (2023) use TESS data to detect and confirm a third set of eclipses in the lightcurve of V994 Herculis, turning it into the second known eclipsing sextuple system. The authors combine TESS photometry from Cycles 2 and 4 with ground-based observations and photo-dynamical modeling to disentangle the three eclipsing binary stars, constrain eclipse timing variations, and evaluate apsidal motion. Zasche et al. (2023) confirm the (2+2)+2 hierarchical configuration of V994 Herculis and measure a period of 1.96 days for the third component of the system. Its component stars have masses of 1.81 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt; and 1.08 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, radii of 1.54 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, and 0.96 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, and effective temperatures of 8514 K and 5893 K, respectively. The orbital eccentricity of the third binary is 0.19. Without the exquisite photometry from TESS, V994 Herculis would have remained as ``only'' a quadruple stellar system for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09932"&gt;The photometric periods of rapidly rotating field ultra-cool dwarfs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Miles-Paez et al. 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rotation behavior of ultra-cool dwarfs (stars with spectral types of M7 or later) provides important information about their formation, structure, and evolution. Observing photometric variability of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs is a critical component in rotation studies and space-based surveys are well-suited to provide such observations. Miles-Paez et al. (2023) examine the photometric variability of all ultra-cool dwarfs with measured V&lt;sub&gt;sini&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; 30 km/sec and brighter than I = 17.5 The authors combine I-band ground-based observations with TESS data for 13 targets of spectral types between M7 and L1.5 to search for periodicity in their lightcurves, constrain photometrically-derived rotation periods and compare them to spectroscopic measurements, and quantify TESS' sensitivity to variable ultra-cool dwarfs. Seven out of the 13 targets were observed by TESS in long- and short-cadence data; Miles-Paez et al. (2023) find evidence for photometric variability in 6 of the 7 targets, which they attribute to rotation. The authors argue that TESS has sufficient sensitivity to detect about 1% photometric variability for targets brighter than T = 16.5 mag with 95% reliability. Using TESS data, Miles-Paez et al. (2023) were also able to refine the rotation periods of another 11 ultra-cool dwarfs observed by the mission. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03704"&gt;TESS-Gaia Light Curve: a PSF-based TESS FFI light curve product&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Han and Brandt 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is expected that the Full-Frame-Image data from TESS will yield tens of thousands of transiting exoplanets, hundreds of thousands of eclipsing binary stars and other variable objects, and millions of other astrophysical transients. Extracting high-precision light-curves from this treasure trove of data is an essential requirement to reach the aforementioned expectations, and has been the primary focus of several ongoing efforts. Han and Brandt (2023) present the latest such effort in the form of TESS-Gaia Light Curves (TGLC) which are based on the combined analysis of TESS and Gaia data. The authors use the latter to constrain the field stars in the TESS images and perform point-spread function photometry to extract TESS light-curves with a percent-level precision for targets brighter than T = 16 mag. Han and Brandt (2023) argue that their light-curves reach photometric precision close to the instrumental noise and, based on a case study of five eclipsing binary stars, note that they show lower noise compared to QLP and Eleanor light-curves. The TGLC data is available on MAST as high level science products (Sector 1 at the time of writing), and the open-source software package (``tglc'') which can be used to extract custom light-curves is also available on GitHub. The improved photometric precision of faint stars as provided by TGLC will, in turn, enhance the discovery potential and scientific impact of the TESS data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03617"&gt;A Second Earth-Sized Planet in the Habitable Zone of the M Dwarf, TOI-700&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Gilbert et al. 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multi-planet systems of transiting planets are ideal laboratories for comparative exoplanetology where the properties of individual planets can be compared and contrasted based on the assumption of co-evolution. Especially interesting are systems where two or more planets reside in the habitable zone, just like our own Solar System. Gilbert et al. (2023) present the discovery and analysis of a second planet, TOI-700 e, residing in the habitable zone of the multi-planet system TOI-700. The host star of TOI-700 is an inactive M2.5 M dwarf at a distance of 31 parsecs, with a mass of 0.415 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, radius of 0.421 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, and Teff = 3459 K. The authors combined custom-made short cadence TESS light-curves from 21 sectors with observations from the CAO 61-cm telescope, performed detailed vetting analysis with the DAVE and VESTA pipelines, and used the EXOFAST V2 package for a global fit to all available photometry. Gilbert et al. (2023) measure an orbital period for TOI-700 e of 27.8 days and radius of 0.95 R&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;, estimate a mass of 0.845 M&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt; based on the forecaster package (with 87% probability). The authors note that the planet receives 1.27 times the Earth's insolation, placing it squarely in the optimistic habitable zone of its host star, and is likely synchronized or pseudo-synchronized. Thy also argue that determining the mass of the planet through spectroscopic observations will be complicated not only due to the expected low radial velocity amplitude (37 cm/sec) but also because the orbital period is close to an integer of the rotation period of the host star (about 54 days). Thanks to TESS, TOI-700 e is the latest addition to the small number of highly-valuable small, habitable-zone planets orbiting bright nearby stars. You can find more about the discovery at &lt;a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-tess-discovers-planetary-systems-second-earth-size-world"&gt;https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-tess-discovers-planetary-systems-second-earth-size-world&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01900"&gt;False Alarms Revealed in a Planet Search of TESS Light Curves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Kunimoto et al. 2023)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigations into the demographics of transiting exoplanets rely on detailed completeness and reliability analysis of the exoplanet catalogs used. Automated detection and vetting pipelines are well-suited to provide such analysis, provided they include a careful treatment of the false alarms associated with the specific dataset. Kunimoto et al. (2023) present a detailed false alarm analysis of transit-like signals detected in TESS data from Sectors 1 to 52. The authors used a Box-Least Squares algorithm to search for transit-like signals in long-cadence QLP and Eleanor light-curves of 92,899 M dwarfs brighter than T = 13.5 mag. To evaluate the false alarms in the data, they repeated the search but instead used the inverted light-curves. This approach should ideally remove genuine transit-like signals, help detect real astrophysical signals such as stellar flares, and preserve the respective systematic effects and general noise properties associated with the data. The authors find prominent signals at aliases of 13.7 days, the orbital period of TESS, and an excess of signals with periods shorter than 1 day, which they associate with scattered light and/or bona-fide stellar variability. These investigations highlighted the importance of including the analysis of inverted TESS light-curves in automated vetting pipelines. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00993"&gt;Observed Rate Variation in Superflaring G-type Stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Crowley et al. 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solar-like stars can produce flaring events four to five orders of magnitude more energetic than those observed from our Sun. Such ``superflares'' can have dramatic effects on the habitability of orbiting planets and it is currently unclear whether our parent star can produce them. Solar flares exhibit a wide range of variability timescales ranging from minutes to hours. Crowley et al. (2022) investigate 274 highly flaring G-type stars observed by TESS for superflares and test whether there are similar short-term variations in the superflare occurrence rate. The authors use the short-cadence data to analyze the lightcurve variability and identify 2703 superflares with energies ranging from 9x10&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; erg to 8.5x&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt; erg. Crowley et al. (2022) found that seven stars in their sample exhibit variability in the corresponding superflare occurrence rate, and noted that there are similarities between the superflare statistics they measured and the Solar flare statistics. The authors argue that at the time of writing there are no reports of short-term variability in supeflare occurrence rates. Thanks to TESS, they were able to able to address this issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02595"&gt;Rediscussion of eclipsing binaries. Paper XII. The F-type twin system ZZ Boötis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Southworth 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eclipsing binary stars serve as calibrators for the fundamental stellar properties, and are ideal laboratories for testing the models of stellar evolution. Systems where the stellar masses and sizes can be measured to high precision are particularly important, especially if the two stars are similar in mass but differ in size. Southworth (2022) utilized TESS data to study in detail one such system, the known F3V ``twin'' binary ZZ Boötis, where the nearly-identical primary and secondary eclipse depths make distinguishing between the two highly challenging. TESS observed the target in Sectors 23 and 50 in short-cadence and detected multiple primary and secondary eclipses with distinct depth differences. The author combined TESS photometry, three sets of archival spectroscopic measurements, and Gaia data to obtain high-precision masses, sizes, effective temperatures and orbital parameters of the system. In addition, they obtained a spectrum from the Isaac Newton Telescope to examine magnetic activity and found no significant chromospheric emission. Southworth (2022) measured an orbital period of 4.992 days, primary star with M = 1.558+/-0.008 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, R = 2.063+/-0.006 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, and Teff = 6720+/-100 K, secondary star with M = 1.599+/-0.012 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, R = 2.205+/-0.006 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, and Teff = 6690+/-100 K, and a system age of 1.7 Gyr. TESS data enabled, for the first time to clearly distinguish which is the primary star and which is the secondary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14752"&gt;Exploring Short-Term Optical Variability of Blazars Using TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Pininti et al. 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blazars are highly-variable, radio-loud active galactic nuclei where the relativistic jets are aligned with the light of sight. The variability is often erratic, usually covers timescales from minutes to decades, and is generally described by either intrinsic (e.g. shocks interacting with turbulent regions) or extrinsic models (e.g. geometrical effects) or a combination of the two. Optical studies of blazar light-curves provide better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the observed variability, and are often conducted from ground-based facilities. This paper presents the detailed analysis of short-term optical variability in the TESS photometry of 29 blazars. Pininti et al. (2022) utilize a total of 79 short-cadence SAP light-curves (both 20-sec and 2-min cadence) to calculate the per-target, per-sector fractional variability and evaluate the corresponding power spectrum density. The level of variability in the target sample varies between a minimum of 0.8% (for 3C 273) to a maximum of 53.8% (for S4 0954+65), with an average of 13.44%. The authors argue that a normal probability distribution function represents the optical variability better than a lognormal distribution, with some sources exhibiting a bimodal normal distribution, and also note that the power spectrum density is consistent with a power-law model with a slope of 2.4. Capitalizing on TESS data, Pininti et al. (2022) performed one of the first systematic analysis of optical blazar variability on timescale of days to weeks.  &lt;/p&gt;

TESS's capability for precision photometry over long time baselines, as well as open access to TESS data, have resulted in extraordinarily high scientific output from the mission across a broad range of astrophysics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 2022, TESS began operations as part of its 2nd Extended Mission. A major highlight of the 2nd Extended Mission is a faster full frame image cadence of 200 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this Splinter session, we provide an overview of the TESS Extended Mission operations and science goals. We particularly showcase TESS's impact across all areas of astronomy, sharing some of the exciting new science being conducted with TESS including exoplanet detections, Solar System science, stellar physics and population studies, and discoveries of transient events and other time-domain astronomy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session will be a hybrid event allowing for virtual and in person attendance. Please note however that you must be registered for AAS 241 to participate in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full details about the session schedule and the WebEx/Zoom link for virtual participation, will be provided at a later date and advertised on the TESS General Investigator home page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07899"&gt;A Low-Mass Pre-Main-Sequence Eclipsing Binary in Lower Centaurus Crux Discovered with TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Stassun et al. 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eclipsing binary stars are key laboratories for testing theoretical models of stellar evolution. Pre-main-sequence systems are particularly crucial as they can be considerably affected by strong surface magnetic fields, highlighting the importance of comprehensive treatment of the latter in evolutionary models. Stassun et al. (2022) present the discovery and detailed analysis of the pre-main-sequence eclipsing binary 2M1222−57. The authors combine TESS photometry with radial velocity from CTIO/CHIRON, speckle imaging from Gemini/Zorro, Gaia, 2MASS and WISE data to discover the system and constrain its physical parameters. 2M1222−57 is a 16.2&amp;plusmn;2.2 Myr system in Lower Centaurus Crux consisting of two M dwarfs orbiting each other every 3.07 days on a nearly circular orbit. Stassun et al. (2022) found evidence of a circumbinary disk, observed H-alpha emission variations synchronized with the orbital period of the binary, and detected a low-mass (~0.2&lt;sub&gt;MSun&lt;/sub&gt;) tertiary companion at a projected separation of about 100 AU. The TESS data helped the authors achieve ~1% precision on the measured stellar masses and sizes -- among the highest for pre-main-sequence eclipsing binaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08490"&gt;A systematic validation of hot Neptunes in TESS data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Magliano et al. 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hot Neptunes are a class of exoplanets with an orbital period shorter than about 4 days and a radius similar to Neptune's. Recent studies have found an intriguing scarcity of such planets -- a "Hot Neptune Desert" -- compared to the much more common Jovian and small rocky exoplanets. Magliano et al. (2022) present the detailed analysis and statistical validation of 250 TESS exoplanet candidates with orbital periods shorter than 4 days and radii between 3 and 5 R&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;. The authors use the DAVE vetting pipeline to mark 62 targets as bona-fide planet candidates and the TRICERATOPS validation pipeline to select 18 of the 62 as likely genuine planets, 9 of which have already been confirmed. For the nine remaining validated candidates, Magliano et al. (2022) determine the stellar parameters through spectral energy distribution modeling, perform detailed transit fits, and the utilize archival follow-up observations from SOAR, Gemini, Lick, WYIN and FLWO for the comprehensive analysis of the systems. The authors calculate the corresponding transit spectroscopy metrics and note that two of the candidates -- TOI-277 b and TOI-1288 b -- are excellent targets for atmospheric characterization through transit spectroscopy. Thanks to TESS, these new validated exoplanets and planet candidates expand the known hot Neptune population, suggesting additional studies and high-priority targets for further research towards understanding their origins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09137"&gt;Short-period pulsating hot-subdwarf stars observed by TESS I. Southern ecliptic hemisphere&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Baran et al. 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hot sub-dwarfs are a diverse set of compact evolved stars divided into two general classes -- sub-dwarfs of spectral type O (sdO) and sub-dwarfs of spectral type B (sdB). The former have effective temperatures in the range 40,000-80,000 K and surface gravities of 4-6.6 log (g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), whereas the latter are cooler (20,000-40,000 K) and cover a narrower range in log (g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) from 5 to 6. Both types can exhibit rapid oscillations that provide deeper understanding of their stellar interiors and evolutionary histories. Baran et al. (2022) present a detailed analysis of short-period oscillations in hot sub-dwarfs observed by TESS in Years 1 and 3. The authors utilize the 20-sec and the 120-sec short-cadence TESS photometry, and spectroscopic data to detect, classify and study pulsations in 43 hot sub-dwarfs. Of these, Baran et al. (2022) identify 32 sdB stars, 2 sdO stars, 8 sdOB stars, and one He-sdOB. The authors note that eight of these are hybrid pulsators and the He-sdOB star is the first that exhibits short-period pulsations. Pulsating sdO stars, in particular, are exceedingly rare and TESS provides an excellent opportunity to expand their numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04386"&gt;Quick-Look Pipeline Light Curves for 5.7 Million Stars Observed Over the Second Year of TESS' First Extended Mission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Kunimoto et al. 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to their nearly-complete sky coverage,TESS's Full-Frame Images (FFI) observe millions of stars enabling the discovery of exoplanets, eclipsing binary stars, and the study of stellar variability. During the first extension of the TESS mission (2020 July - September 2022), the scientific potential of the FFIs has further increased as the cadence changed from 30-min to 10-min. Kunimoto et al. (2022) present the second release of Quick-Look Pipeline FFI light curves from the second year of TESS' first extended mission (Sectors 40-55), which covers the northern hemisphere and the ecliptic plane. The authors extracted 12.2 million individual light curves for 5.7 million stars and provide them as high level science products available on MAST. In contrast to their previous light curve release, the target list of Kunimoto et al. (2022) includes stars with T &amp;lt; 15 mag, T&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 4000 K, and R &amp;lt; 0.8 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;. The authors report 1-hr photometric precision of the their new light curves of ~2-3 x 10^3 ppm at T = 14 mag, which allows the detection of transiting exoplanets even around faint M-dwarfs where the photometric precision is typically low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03811"&gt;Revealing the progenitor of SN 2021zby through analysis of the TESS shock-cooling light curve&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Wang et al. 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type IIb supernovae exhibit hydrogen lines during the early phases of the explosion, and are  currently most likely attributed to either a star less massive than about 20 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt; in a binary system, or a single star with mass between about 25 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt; and 80 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;. Occasionally, Type IIb supernovae may produce an early flux excess that occurs before the main maximum, thus exhibiting a double peak in the early light curve. Wang et al. (2022) present a detailed analysis of the spectro-photometric time series of the double-peaked Type IIb supernova SN 2021zby during the first 2 months after explosion. The authors combine long-cadence TESS data from Sectors 42, 43, and 44 with photometry from DECam and ATLAS, and spectroscopy from SSO, IRTF, INT, NTT, LCO, Lick and Liverpool observatories into a multi-band model to fit the data and infer the properties of the progenitor. Wang et al. (2022) argue that the progenitor was likely a red or yellow supergiant with an envelope mass between 0.3 and 3 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt; and radius between about 50 and 350 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, in line with other double-peaked Type IIb supernovae. This study highlights the critical part TESS plays in catching the light of supernovae just days after the explosion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06194"&gt;15000 Ellipsoidal Binary Candidates in TESS: Orbital Periods, Binary Fraction, and Tertiary Companions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Green et al. 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short-period binary stars are key tracers of stellar evolution as progenitors for supernovae, stellar mergers, cataclysmic variables, etc. In turn, large catalogs of short-period binaries with relatively high sample completeness and well-quantified selection functions are vital for detailed studies of these systems. Green et al. (2022) present a sample of 15,779 candidate binary systems with main-sequence primaries and orbital periods shorter than 5 days, selected according to the presence of tidally-induced ellipsoidal modulations. The authors utilize the TESS ELEANOR pipeline for the Northern hemisphere and the TESS Quick-Look pipeline for the Southern Hemisphere, and the BEER algorithm to analyze the light curves of 4,301,148 targets brighter than T &amp;lt; 13.5 mag. Their spectroscopic follow-up from LCO indicates that the sample purity is 83\pm13\%. Green et al. (2022) find that the frequency of confirmed ellipsoidal companions is 0.0037\pm0.0006, the overall companion frequency for periods shorter than 3 days is 0.01\pm0.002 with a completeness of 28\pm3\%. The authors estimate that 39\pm4\% of their sample are contact binary systems with an orbital period pile-up near 0.4 days, and note a 29\pm5\% frequency of tertiary components for the shortest-period systems. These TESS-enabled results provide an important resource for further studies of short-period detached and contact binary stars. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17062"&gt;TESS Giants Transiting Giants III: An eccentric warm Jupiter supports a period-eccentricity relation for giant planets transiting evolved stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Grunblatt et al. 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discovering planets on short, eccentric orbits around evolved stars is important for better understanding a suite of astrophysical processes including star-planet interactions, planet radius inflation, occurrence rates, etc. This paper presents the discovery and analysis of TOI-4582 b, an eccentric warm Jupiter in orbit around a star with a log(g) = 3.77. Grunblatt et al. (2022) combine Full-Frame image TESS data from Sectors 14-26 with radial velocity measurements from Keck/HIRES and FLWO/TRES, Gaia data, observations from the 2.5m SAI and the 3.5m WIYN telescopes, and MESA isochrone models to analyze the system and characterize the planet and its host star TOI-4582. The planet has an orbital period of 31.034 days, eccentricity of 0.51, radius of 0.94 R&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt; and mass of 0.53 M&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;. The star has a radius of 2.5 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, mass of 1.34 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, T&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; = 5190 K, age of 4 Gyr, rotation period of about 73 days. The authors find no evidence for resolved stellar companions in the imaging data or for unresolved companions in the spectroscopic data. Grunblatt et al. (2022) note that, at the time of writing, TOI-4582 b is one of the longest-period and most eccentric planets transiting a star with log(g) &amp;lt; 3.8. The shorter cadence and longer baseline of the extended TESS mission will provide important new insight into TOI-4582 b and similar systems, potentially including detailed asteroseismological characterization.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15692"&gt;Characterisation of the NUV and Optical Emission and Temperature of Flares from Ross 733 with Swift and TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Jackman 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simultaneous multi-wavelength observations provide key information on the mechanisms underlying stellar activity, in particular on the high-energy emission of low-mass stars. This paper presents the results of coordinated near-ultraviolet and optical observations of the M-star spectroscopic binary Ross 733. Jackman (2022) combine 2-min cadence TESS photometry from Sector 40 (as part of a Target of Opportunity request) and 12.4 ks photometry from Swift obtained with the UVM2 filter to examine the flare activity of the system. The author detects and visually confirms 40 flare candidates in TESS data, calculates the corresponding flare rate, and estimates the flare energies assuming a 9000K blackbody spectrum.  Jackman (2022) detects two NUV flares in Swift data, one lasting 120 sec and the other 15 min. The author calculates a total system flare energy of 10^33 erg every 1.5 days, measures a pseudo-continuum temperature of 7340 K, finds that a 9000 K blackbody model underestimates the number of expected flares, and argues that this is likely due to higher peak flare continuum temperatures and contribution from line emission. TESS continues to be a key mission for joint observational efforts aimed at multi-wavelength flare detection and characterization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15163"&gt;Asteroseismology of PG 1541+651 and BPM 31594 with TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Romero et al. 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of the stars in the Galaxy will evolve into white dwarfs, about 80% of which will end up as ZZ Ceti type variables. These are pulsating white dwarfs that exhibit pulsation amplitudes of 1-60 parts per thousands and periods of 70-3000 sec. This paper presents a detailed asteroseismology analysis of two warm-like ZZ Ceti variable, PG 1541+651 and BPM 31594, previously discovered as such from ground-based observations. Romero et al. (2022) use 20-sec and 120-sec cadence TESS data from sectors 14-17, 21-24, 41, 47, 48, 50, and 51 (for PG 1541+651) and sectors 3, 4, 30, 31 (for BPM 31594), and Fourier transforms to detect pulsations from the two targets. The authors detected 12 pulsation modes for PG 1541+651 and six for BPM 31594 and identified rotation period of about 22 hours for the former and about 11.5 hours for the latter. From their asteroseismological fit, they estimated stellar masses of about 0.6 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt; for both targets, effective temperature of 11,240 K for PG 1541+651 and 11,560 K for BPM 31594, mass of the hydrogen envelope of 2.7x10^-6 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt; for the former and 4.8x10^-5 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt; for the latter. The dramatic increase in the number of detected pulsations modes thanks to TESS highlights the importance of high-quality, short-cadence, long-duration observations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09848"&gt;Maximum Likelihood Systematic Effect Modeling and Matched Filtering to Detect Trans-Neptunian Objects with TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Ganapathi 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) are small, faint, primitive bodies in the outer Solar System, that provide important insight into its formation and evolution. While primarily designed as an exoplanet mission, TESS is well-suited to find such objects by capitalizing on the full-frame images it captures. This paper presents a new TNO detection pipeline based on a novel optimization-based framework. Ganapathi (2022) utilizes a matched filter, based on TESS's pixel-response-function, to directly model systematic effects due to scattered light and/or sub-pixel jitter. The algorithm is optimized for graphics processing unit computations, is capable of detecting objects fainter than T = 21 mag at distances of up to 250 AU, and the author notes that is thousands of times faster than previous methods. Ganapathi (2022) demonstrated that the algorithm can automatically recover known TNOs observed in Sector 5 at a high level of confidence, and enables the identification of two TNO candidates by visual inspection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09109"&gt;A Catalogue of Solar-Like Oscillators Observed by TESS in 120-second and 20-second Cadence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Hatt et al., 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intrinsic oscillations in Solar-like stars are a powerful tool to determine high-precision stellar masses and size. TESS provides short-cadence observations of a large number of solar-like oscillators, including less evolved stars, and has already made significant contribution in the field. This paper presents new astroseismological analysis of more than 250,000 main sequence and sub-giant stars observed at 20-sec and 120-sec cadence in Sectors 1 through 46. Hatt et al. (2022) applied a novel probabilistic detection algorithm and found solar-like oscillations in 4,177 stars. Of these, 12 are previously-known solar oscillators, 752 are included in the Asteroseismic Target List, and 486 were observed at a 20-sec cadence. The remaining targets are brighter than Ks = 12 mag, have effective temperatures in the range of 4500 K to 6500 K, and were observed at a 120-sec cadence. The authors manually vetted all targets to rule out common sources of false positives such as eclipsing binaries, transiting planets, or classical pulsators. There are 28 spectroscopic binaries, and 28 have confirmed planets. Hatt et al. (2022) also measured the large frequency separation and the frequency at maximum power for 98% of the sample. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00544"&gt;Detection of p-mode Oscillations in HD 35833 with NEID and TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Gupta et al., 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HD 35833 is a bright (T = 6.2 mag) G0 subgiant star observed by TESS in Sectors 6, 32, 43, 44, and 45 at a 2-min cadence, and a prime target for detailed asteroseismic investigations. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of p-mode oscillations in HD 35833, combining the high-precision photometry from TESS with high-resolution radial velocity measurements from the NEID spectrograph. Gupta et al. (2022) achieve clear, independent detection of an oscillation signal in both datasets. From the TESS lightcurves for Sectors 6, 43, 44, and 45, the authors measure a photometric amplitude of about 6 ppm, frequency of maximum power of 595.71 microHz, and mode spacing of 36.65 microHz; from the NEID data, they infer a radial velocity amplitude of about 1 m/sec. Gupta et al. (2022) note that the oscillations amplitudes are smaller than expected, but they could not attribute the discrepancy to known suppression mechanisms. The asteroseismically derived stellar parameters of HD 35833 indicate an effective temperature of T&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; = 5684 K, luminosity L = 7.15 L&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, M = 1.42 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, and R = 2.76 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would first like to highlight some of the exciting TESS-related news from MAST.

&lt;p&gt;This week, we are looking at three recent papers from the archive. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05051"&gt;TIC 452991707 and TIC 452991693 as a Candidate Sextuple System with Three Eclipsing Binaries&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Zasche &amp;#x0026; Henzl, 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eclipsing binary stars are one of the principal components of stellar astrophysics, and enable the precise measurement of fundamental stellar parameters. Eclipsing binaries discovered in triple and higher order systems provide important insight into how stars form and evolve in multiple stellar systems. This paper presents the discovery of a rare candidate sextuple system composed of three eclipsing binaries, two associated with TIC 452991707 and one with TIC 452991693, with an on-sky separation of about 16 arcsec. Zasche &amp;#x0026;  Henzl (2022) use long-cadence TESS data from sectors 17 and 18 to detect eclipses following three distinct periods, 1.04 days, 1.46 days, and 1.77 days. Their analysis indicates that the shortest-period eclipsing binary originates from TIC 452991693, the other two eclipsing binaries originate from TIC 452991707. Based on the available data, Zasche &amp;#x0026; Henzl (2022) estimate a preliminary outer orbital period of the sextuple system of about 7 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02437"&gt;A search for transiting planets around hot subdwarfs II. Supplementary methods and results from TESS Cycle 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Thuillier et al., 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hot subdwarfs, also known as extreme horizontal branch stars, are compact, hot, He-burning post-red-giant branch stars. These objects are prime targets for studying stellar and planetary evolution beyond the main sequence. However, to date, there are no confirmed planets around them. This paper presents results from a project aimed at performing systematic search for planetary transits in the lightcurves of hot subdwarfs observed by space-based telescopes, and determining the occurrence frequency as a function of planet radius and orbital period. Thuillier et al. (2022) studied 792 hot subdwarfs observed by TESS in short-cadence mode during cycle 1. The authors identified a total of 352 potential signals in 243 targets; 46 of these signals survived further vetting and validation, of which 30 were promoted for follow-up observations. Several of these signals have been attributed to eclipsing binaries or transiting white dwarfs. Thuillier et al. (2022) report that no confirmed planetary signals have been identified at the time of writing, and note that they are able to detect transiting objects as small as 2 R&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;, with orbital periods shorter than 15 days, and Gaia magnitudes between 13 and 14. The authors also ruled out the presence of 3 R&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt; planets with periods longer than 1 day around 90% of the studied hot subdwarfs, and 0.5 R&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt; planets around 50% of the hot subdwarfs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01220"&gt;A TESS search for substellar companions through pulsation timing of δ Scuti stars. I. Discovery of companions around Chang 134 and V393 Car&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Vaulato et al., 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delta Scuti stars are population I pulsators residing in the classical Cepheid instability strip, and one of the least explored type of stellar hosts in exoplanet searches. The prominent stellar variability of these stars presents a clear challenge for the two most productive exoplanet detection methods, transit observations and radial velocity measurements. This paper presents the search for exoplanets around δ Scuti variables adopting a different technique -- phase modulations in pulsation timing caused by the light-travel-effect from an orbiting body. Vaulato et al. (2022) performed harmonic analysis and light-travel-time modeling on the short-cadence data of two high-amplitude pulsators, Chang 134 and V393 Carinae, and detected periodic modulations in both systems. The authors argued that the modulations are consistent with the brown dwarf in orbit around Chang 134 with a period of about 82 days and mass m&lt;sub&gt;sini&lt;/sub&gt; = 43.1+/-4.7M&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;, and a more massive body (m&lt;sub&gt;sini&lt;/sub&gt; ~ 0.1-0.17 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;) in orbit around V393 Car with an unconstrained period. Vaulato et al. (2022) note that future TESS observations would help constrain the eccentricity of the inferred orbits of these companions.&lt;/p&gt;

Before we highlight some of the more recent papers from the archive, we would like to introduce you to the newest member of our team -- Dr. Nicole Schanche -- who is joining us as a TESS GI Support Scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, we are looking at three recent papers from the archive. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04080"&gt;Revisiting the Transit Timing Variations in the TrES-3 and Qatar-1 systems with TESS data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Mannaday et al., 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deviations from linear ephemeris in the measured transit times of exoplanets provide important tests for the presence of additional planets in the system, orbital decay and/or apsidal motion. Combining high-precision photometry from multiple observatories is an important ingredient in these tests, even more so when the observations cover a large number of planetary orbits. This paper presents the analysis of transit timing variations (TTV) of two hot Jupiters -- TrES-3b and Qatar-1b -- using data from TESS, the 1.23 m Zeiss telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory, the exoplanet transit database, and the MAST archive. Mannady et al. (2022) analyzed 182 transits of TrES-3b and 228 transits of Qatar-1b covering more than a decade of observations and refined the respective ephemerides. The authors found indications of transit timing variations for both systems, argued that these are unlikely to be short-term and periodic, and ruled out additional planets in close orbits to the known planets. They also noted that the detected variations in TrES-3b cannot be attributed to apsidal precession, orbital decay, or the Applegate mechanism, whereas line-of-sight acceleration could be the cause of the detected TTVs for Qatar-1b. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03379"&gt;A Population of Dipper Stars from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite Mission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Capistrant et al., 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dipper stars are a subclass of young stellar objects (YSO) that exhibit episodic or quasi-periodic brightness decreases of up to about 10-50%. The physical processes responsible for this variability include chromospheric activity, accretion, occultation, etc. This paper presents the discovery and characterization of a large number of dippers and other variable sources observed by TESS. Capistrant et al. (2022) harness the power of citizen science to identify and analyze 293 dippers, of which 234 are new candidates, and another 121 variables. The authors measure dipper ages in the range of 1 to 40 Myr, with a peak around 2 Myr, and indicate that dippers older than 10 Myr exhibit IR excess, suggesting disk retention even for these older systems. They find no correlation between the morphology of the studied light curves and the corresponding effective temperature, and note that the burster systems are predominantly young (although a larger sample is needed to confirm the trend). Capistrant et al. (2022) argue that such a large sample of dippers would provide better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the observed variability and help investigations aimed at characterizing variable stars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11721"&gt;CoRoT-TESS eclipsing binaries with light-travel-time effect&lt;/a&gt;(https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01142)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Hajdu et al., 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to transit timing variations in exoplanet systems, period changes in eclipsing binary stars can be attributed to the gravitational perturbations from a third body on a distant orbit. Such triple systems are valuable tracers of stellar formation and evolution, and can produce exotic systems such as binary neutron stars or blue stragglers. This paper presents a detailed analysis of timing variations in eclipsing binary stars (EBs) combining data from the CoRoT and TESS space telescopes. Hajdu et al. (2022) investigate 1428 EBs observed by both telescopes and probe for the presence of tertiary bodies. The authors identify four potential hierarchical triple star candidates (CoRoT ID 102631642, 102760539, 102788679, and 221659671) where the measured eclipse timing variations are consistent with the light-travel-time effect. The corresponding outer orbital periods range between ~1340 and ~6000 days, with orbital eccentricities between 0.17 and 0.66. For three of these systems, the TESS data was key to detect a period change in the corresponding EB, highlighting the synergy between observations from multiple telescopes. Another five systems (CoRoT ID 102285983, 102383485, 102568782, 102573289, and 102574112) exhibit significant eclipse timing variations consistent with either apsidal motion or parabolic trends, the latter potentially caused by mass transfer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14855"&gt;Short Duration Accretion States of Polars as seen in TESS and ZTF data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Duffy et al., 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cataclysmic variables (CV) where the magnetic field of the white dwarf exceeds about 10MG may not form an accretion disk. Instead, the accreted matter falls close to polar regions of the white dwarf, and the system is classified as a Polar CV or AM Her. This paper presents the analysis of short duration accretion states (shorter than about 60 days) of a number of Polars observed by TESS and ZTF. Duffy et al. (2022) study 55 targets with sufficient ZTF-g and ZTF-r data (defined as more than 25 data points) and 9 targets observed by TESS in 2-min cadence, where 3 of the targets overlap between the two datasets. The authors found that short duration states are a common occurrence in Polars, generalized the model of star spot migration, probed the accretion geometry of some of the systems, and refined the orbital period of CW Hyi. Duffy et al. (2022) note that polarimetry, X-ray observations, and more Polars observed by TESS would help advance the understanding of these systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12276"&gt;Validation of TESS exoplanet candidates orbiting solar analogues in the all-sky PLATO input catalogue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Mantovan et al., 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;False positives due to background eclipsing binary stars are a common feature in searches for transiting exoplanets. Multiple vetting and validation methods have been developed to address this issue, and have been extensively utilized by the community. This paper presents the probabilistic validation of all TESS Objects of Interest (TOI) found around "Solar twins" that are also part of the PLATO input catalog. Mantovan et al. (2022) combine the VESPA package, Gaia EDR3 data, and measurements of the center-of-light during transit to analyze 158 such TOIs. The authors statistically vet 23 of these as bona-fide candidates, five of which have been confirmed to be on-target, and greatly enhanced the on-target probability for another three candidates. Mantovan et al. (2022) argue that the five confirmed candidates are prime targets for high-precision radial velocity measurements and note that they will complete their follow-up observations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11721"&gt;Variability Catalog of Stars Observed During the TESS Prime Mission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Fetherolf et al., 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stars vary with time due to internal and/or external processes such as stellar rotation, pulsations, eclipses, etc. The TESS lightcurves provide a prime resource to study these variations across diverse stellar types, environments, and evolutionary stages. This paper presents a detailed analysis of 232,000 stars observed in 2-min cadence and a corresponding stellar catalog of variability on timescales shorter than 13 days. Fetherolf et al. (2022) use Lomb-Scargle periodograms and utilize the auto-correlation Function method to detect about 40,000 astrophysically variable stars with high confidence and about 50,000 with moderate confidence. The authors argue that the period and amplitude of detected photometric variability can be used as stellar classification metrics, and find a relative lack of variability of dwarf stars in the 1.5-2 day range. Fetherolf et al. (2022) note that results from this work would help better understand how stellar variability affects the measured properties of exoplanets and also shed light on the evolution of planetary systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10433"&gt;Taranga DR1: Analysis of TESS Short Cadence data for years 1 and 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Nandakumar et al., 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of its 2-year primary mission, TESS provided 2-min cadence photometry of more than 200,000 stars spread across the entire sky -- a rich dataset enabling a multitude of detailed studies of stars and exoplanets. This paper presents Taranga, a new pipeline designed for the analysis of short-cadence TESS data. Nandakumar et al., (2022) applied the pipeline to 232,122 stars to create merged multi-sector light curves and Lomb-Scargle periodograms for all short-cadence targets, and calculate the statistical and temporal properties of the dataset. The authors argue that the merging algorithm used in the pipeline is best-suited for either AGB stars, or for stars with long rotational periods. Nandakumar et al., (2022) note that the results from their work can also be used for the planning and preparation of upcoming missions such as PLATO and the Roman Space Telescope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10855"&gt;Superhumps in the cataclysmic variable BG Tri&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Stefanov et al., 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BG Triangulum is a relatively bright (V = 11.9 mag) cataclysmic variable discovered and identified in 2008. It is classified as a VY Scl subclass, has the spectroscopic characteristics of a RW Sex variable, shows significant UV excess, and exhibited a 2.5 V magnitude decrease in brightness in 2018. This paper presents the observations and detailed analysis of the system using ground and space-based photometry. Stefanov et al., (2022) use data from ASAS-SN, NSVS, the Rozhen Observatory, TESS, and WASP to detect a positive superhump with a period of 0.1727 days in 2006 data, a negative superhump with a period of 0.1515 days in 2019-2021 data, and a super-orbital variability with a period of 3.94 days and amplitude of 0.05 mag. The authors estimate the disk tilt to be about 3 degrees and note that the most common quasi-periods are in the 5-25 min range. Stefanov et al., (2022) argue that future observations will provide better understanding of the detected superhump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10854"&gt;TOI-4562 b: A highly eccentric temperate Jupiter analog orbiting a young field star&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Heitzmann et al., 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giant planets in distant orbits around young stars provide valuable insight into the processes driving planet formation and evolution. Of particular interest are those with measured mass and high eccentricity. This paper presents the discovery of TOI-4562 b, a temperate Jovian planet in orbit around a ~300 Myr old F7V star. Heitzmann et al., (2022) use data from CHIRON, FEROS, Gemini-South, the Las Cumbres Observatory, SOAR and TESS to confirm the planet, measure a period of 225 days, radius of 1.07 R&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;, mass of 3.29 M&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;, and orbital eccentricity of 0.81. TOI-4562 b, located near the southern continuous viewing zone of TESS, allowed observations throughout 25 sectors, enabling an unambiguous period of measurement and at the time of writing, is the second longest period planet discovered from TESS data. The authors point out that a high-eccentric migration is an unlikely formation scenario, although they note that the planet may be currently undergoing eccentricity cycles. Heitzmann et al., (2022) suggest that another possibility might be either in-situ formation or smooth disk migration followed by dynamical interaction with a companion. The authors tentatively detect transit-timing variations on the order of 5-20 min, suggesting potential perturbations from a companion, and argue that future observations will help constrain its properties. &lt;/p&gt;

Before we get started with the papers, we would first like to advertise the Atmospheric Characterization Working Group (ACWG).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ACWG works to ensure the successful legacy of the TESS mission, specifically as it relates to the atmospheric characterization of its discovered exoplanets. The group currently pursues several tasks, including identifying the most promising TESS-discovered exoplanets for atmospheric characterization, coordinating with other TESS working groups to enable atmospheric characterization efforts, providing a venue for research groups to coordinate their atmospheric characterization observations, and advocating for programs and procedures that will lead to successful atmospheric characterization of TESS-discovered exoplanets.  The ACWG maintains a &lt;a href="https://tess.mit.edu/science/tess-acwg/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; where various community resources related to atmospheric characterization of TESS-discovered exoplanets can be found. The group is open to accepting new members. Details can be found on the &lt;a href="https://tess.mit.edu/science/tess-acwg/#apply-to-join-the-acwg"&gt;"apply to join page"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05797"&gt;TOI-2196 b: Rare planet in the hot Neptune desert transiting a G-type star&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Persson et al., 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hot Neptune desert is a sparsely populated region in the period-equilibrium temperature diagram of exoplanets containing relatively few planets with radii between about 2 and 4 R&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;, and orbital periods of a few days. Currently, there are only a handful of known such planets with equilibrium temperatures above 1800 K and radius and/or mass known within an order of 10% precision or better. This paper presents the discovery of TOI-2196 b, with an orbital period of 1.2 days, G-type host star, radius of 3.5+/-0.15 R&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;, and mass of 26+/-1.3 M&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;. Persson et al. (2022) performed joint transit and radial velocity modeling of the system using data from TESS Sectors 13 and 27, the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope (LCOGT), the Southern Astrophysical Research telescope (SOAR), and the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS). Persson et al. (2022) note that while TOI-2196 b has a smaller radius compared to Neptune, it is nearly 50% as massive, and thus has a comparably higher bulk density for its type. In addition, the authors detect a linear trend in the measured radius velocities, suggestive of a longer-period outer planet candidate with a minimum mass of about 0.65 M&lt;sub&gt;Jupiter&lt;/sub&gt; and argue that long-term RV monitoring can determine the nature of that potential candidate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.057892"&gt;TIC 114936199: A Quadruple Star System with a 12-day Outer Orbit Eclipse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Powell et al., 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systems of gravitationally bound, eclipsing multiple stars are important tracers of the physical processes responsible for stellar formation and evolution in dynamically rich environments. As the number of stars and their corresponding orbital configurations increases, so does the complexity of the produced observational signatures. Of particular note are quadruple systems with eclipses and/or occultations on the outer orbits. This paper presents the discovery of an exceedingly rare quadruple system producing a complex 12-day series of eclipses on the outer orbit. Powell et al. (2022) combine data from TESS (Sectors 14, 40, 53, and 54), the 80-cm RC telescope of Gothard Astrophysical Observatory, and from the Tillinghast  Reflector  Echelle  Spectrograph  (TRES) into a spectro-photo-dynamical model to solve for the orbital configuration of the TIC 114936199 system, and obtain the physical and orbital parameters of its constituents. The system consists of an eclipsing binary with an orbital period of 3.3 days, a third star with an orbital period of 51.2 days, and a fourth star with an orbital period of 2099 days, with a 2+1+1 hierarchical configuration. Utilizing Gaia data, Powell et al. (2022) also argue that this is, in fact, a quintuple system with a 2+1+1+1 configuration, where the outermost star has an orbital period of about 900 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04791"&gt;Kepler and TESS Observations of PG 1159-035&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Oliveira da Rosa et al., 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PG 1159-035 is a class-defining white dwarf, one of the hottest pulsating stars, and is characterized by strong deficiency in H lines and high excitation in He II, C IV, O VI, and N V lines. It is a prime target for astroseismological studies and has been monitored for more than four decades, including from the McDonald observatory, the Whole Earth Telescope, K2 and, most recently, TESS using 20-second cadence data. This paper presents a detailed astroseismological analysis of PG 1159-035 and an investigation into the pulsation properties. Oliveira de Rosa et al. (2022) identify 107 frequencies distributed in 44 separate modes, and possible surface rotational frequency at 8.904+/-0.003 microHz (corresponding to a surface rotation period of 1.299 days), making it the second hottest subdwarf with a photometrically-detected surface rotation. The authors detect 9 combination frequencies and note that the period change rate at the highest amplitude modes do not follow a clear pattern and seem to be converging to a specific value before scattering again. Oliveira de Rosa et al. (2022) calculate the mass of PG 1159-035 to be 0.54-0.59 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, consistent with spectroscopic estimates, and argue that their results provide evidence of nonuniform rotation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HD 93963 A is a bright nearby G0V star, a member of a visual binary system, and host to TESS Object of Interest, TOI-1797.01. TOI-1797.01 is a sub-Neptune with an orbital period of 3.65 days, first reported in 2021. This paper presents the discovery of another planet in the system, interior to TOI-1797.01. Serrano et al. (2022) use data from TESS, CHEOPS, ground-based photometry and adaptive-optics imaging, and spectroscopy from TRES, FIES and SOPHIE to detect, validate and characterize a super-Earth with an orbital period of 1.04 days. The planet has a radius of 1.35 R&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;, predicted mass of 2.4 M&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;, and equilibrium temperature of 2042 K (assuming zero albedo). The two planets fall on the opposite sides of the photo-evaporation radius valley and the authors suggest that they may have experienced drastically different evolutionary paths. The presented results provide important new information for the HD 93963A systems and demonstrate the power of combining observations from multiple instruments and facilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12922"&gt;Periodic variable A-F spectral type stars in the northern TESS continuous viewing zone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Skarka et al., 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photometric variability of A-F stars is an important diagnostic for probing the transition between fast and slow rotators, and radiative and convective energy transfer, as well as p- and g-mode pulsations. Prominent examples are stars of the gamma Doradus and delta Scuti types (including hybrid pulsators), SX Phe stars, and more. This paper presents a detailed investigation of A-F stars observed in the TESS northern ecliptic pole, including visual classification of the type of variability. Skarka et al. (2022) inspected 5923 stars brighter than T = 11 mag, identified 3025 of these as variable, and classified 1813 of them following the VSX scheme and using the light curve shape and corresponding Fourier transform. The authors found that the gamma Doradus, the delta Scuti variables, and the hybrid pulsators to be the most numerous, which is in accordance with previous studies. Of the stars classified as eclipsing binaries, the authors noted that only 56% of the identified targets are listed in the TESS eclipsing binary catalog, although this is likely due to the fact that the latter is exclusively based on the short-cadence. The authors identified a new subclass of relatively cool variable stars exhibiting periodic modulations and harmonics of the basic Fourier frequency and argued that these targets are unlikely to be explained by co-rotating structures governed by high-order magnetic multipoles. Skarka et al. (2022) note that they will perform similar analysis using data from the southern continuous viewing zone of TESS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12522"&gt;Exploring the Dependence of Hot Jupiter Occurrence Rates on Stellar Mass with TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Beleznay &amp;amp; Kunimoto 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hot Jupiters are giant, short-period planets that provide important information for the processes responsible for planet formation and evolution. Despite being the predominant class of planets found in the early stages of exoplanet discovery, they are, in fact, relatively rare. Their typical occurrence rate is about 1% around Sun-like stars, with a slight tension between RV surveys and Kepler data as the former prefers a value of ~0.8-1.2% vs. ~0.4-0.6% for the latter. Several explanations have been invoked to explain this discrepancy, one of which involves a dependence on the stellar mass. This paper presents improved estimates for the occurrence rate of hot Jupiters around AFG stars observed by TESS. Beleznay &amp;amp; Kunimoto (2022) independently detect and vet 97 planets and planet candidates using 26 sectors of data. The authors estimate a false positive rate of 14%, 16% and 0% for A, F, and G stars, respectively. They calculate a weighted average occurrence rate of hot Jupiters around AFG stars of 0.33+/-0.04% -- in agreement with results based on Kepler data -- with star-type-specific rates of 0.29+/-0.05% for A stars, 0.36+/-0.06% for F stars, and 0.55+/-0.14% for G stars. Taking into account stellar binarity amongst their sample of G stars, the authors calculate single-star hot Jupiter occurrence rates of 0.98+/-0.36%, in line with the results from RV surveys. Beleznay &amp;amp; Kunimoto (2022) argue that correcting for stellar multiplicity can fully account for the discrepancy in the calculated occurrence rates of hot Jupiters between RV and transit surveys. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09838"&gt;Eccentric orbits and apsidal motion in the eclipsing binaries EK Cep and HS Her&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Latkovic et al., 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young detached eclipsing binary stars are important systems in which to test theories regarding stellar structure, formation, and evolution. Previous studies of two such systems -- EK Cep and HS Her -- mostly relied on pre-CCD observations and often suffered from high noise and sparse phase coverage. This paper presents results from a comprehensive, up-to-date analysis of these two systems. Latkovic et al. (2022) use PHOEBE 1.0 to model new photometric observations from TESS and the University of Athens Observatory, and spectroscopic observations from NAO Rozhen. The authors use all available data to perform a detailed eclipse timing analysis. The orbital and stellar parameters calculated from PHOEBE are in excellent agreement with the eclipse-time measurements, showing that both binaries are slightly eccentric and exhibit clear apsidal motion. Comparisons with evolutionary tracks indicate that the age of EK Cep is between 16 and 20 Myrs, and HS Her is between 25 and 32 Myrs. Latkovic et al. (2022) argue that their results ruled out a tertiary companion to HS Her, and note that continued observations will place stronger constraints on the variations in the orbital parameters of EK Cep. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08917"&gt;TESS Observations of Kepler systems with Transit Timing Variations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Jontof-Hutter et al., 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transit timing variations provide a powerful tool for characterizing exoplanet masses. The SNR of the variations increase with the orbital period, and a longer observational baseline adds value to the measurements by further improving the constraints of the models used. This paper presents the analysis of transit timing variations of multiplanet systems observed by Kepler and TESS. Jontof-Hutter et al. (2022) use data from TESS Sectors 14, 15, 26, 40, and 41 and pixel-level decorrelation to detect 48 transits of 13 Kepler exoplanets. The authors argue that a TESS transit of Kepler-89e is inconsistent with the expectations based on the known configuration of the system, they found strong evidence of an additional, non-transiting perturber in the Kepler-396 system, and they note that the studied systems are among the faintest Kepler targets with reasonable photometric precision achieved by TESS. In addition, Jontof-Hutter et al. (2022) refine the ephemerides and further constrain the masses of Kepler-9, Kepler-18, Kepler-20, Kepler-25, Kepler-30, Kepler-37, Kepler-51, Kepler-89, Kepler-102, Kepler-130, Kepler-289, and Kepler-1662.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08203"&gt;TESS light curves of cataclysmic variables I -- Unknown periods in long-known stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Bruch, 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cataclysmic variables are interacting binary stars experiencing mass transfer from the secondary to the primary star. These systems exhibit rich, prominent variability, such as orbital and rotational variations, and positive or negative superhumps. Due to its underlying complexity and the fact that it spans a range of different timescales, studying this variability requires long-term, high-cadence, uninterrupted photometric monitoring. This paper presents the search of periodic variations in a sample of 15 nova-like and old novae cataclysmic variables observed by TESS. Bruch (2022) uses the short-cadence TESS lightcurves and applies Fourier techniques to calculate periodograms of the target stars. The author finds an abundance of new superhumps, yet no preference for their occurrence or lack thereof based on the type of the cataclysmic variable, and identifies unusual features in known superhumps. Bruch (2022) also notes that negative superhumps are more common than positive, detects the spin period of TV Col in optical light, highlights the time-dependent frequency of CP Pup, and argues that the occurrence of superhumps is a common feature of cataclysmic variables rather than an exception. &lt;/p&gt;

Before we highlight some of the more recent papers from the archive, we would like to introduce you to the newest member of our team -- Dr. Tyler Pritchard -- who is joining us as a TESS GI Support Scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, we are looking at three papers from the archive. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00058"&gt;Understanding Accretion Variability Through TESS Observations of Taurus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Robinson et al., 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A prominent observational signature of classical T Tauri stars is variability produced by multiple processes and spanning a range of timescales. Most progress in the field has been aimed at understanding the observed variability on timescales of hours to days, while only a handful of studies focused on variability on timescales of minutes to hours. This paper presents the analysis of the latter type of variability in 14 T Tauri stars in the Taurus star-forming region. Robinson et al. (2022) combine TESS short-cadence data with ground-based UBVRI photometry from the Lower Discovery Telescope and HST NUV-NIR spectroscopy to estimate rotation periods, empirically classify the observed variability, measure mass accretion rates, and identify time-lags between. The authors argue that some of the variability detected in TESS data can be linked to accretion. They have also uncovered evidence for longitudinal density stratification of accretion columns, have identified CY Tau as a face-on dipper, and found no clear global correlation between TESS flux and the accretion luminosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00343"&gt;Revisiting bright delta Scuti stars and their period-luminosity relation with TESS and Gaia DR3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Barac et al., 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Period-luminosity relations of variable stars such as Cepheids, RR Lyr, and delta Scuti have been studied for decades. Many of these studies have measured periods using ground-based observations which are subject to the day-night cycle and affected by atmospheric variability. The continuous, high-cadence, high-precision, all-sky photometry from TESS provides the opportunity to refine these measured periods and more accurately position the targets on a period-luminosity diagram. This paper presents the analysis of 434 delta Scuti star observed from TESS, including targets with only a handful of prior observations. Barac et al. (2022) combine three years of short and long-cadence TESS photometry with Gaia DR3 parallaxes to measure the frequency and amplitude of the strongest pulsations modes for 372 delta Scuti stars. They find most of these lie on a ridge in the period-luminosity diagram corresponding to pulsations in the fundamental radial mode, confirm the presence of a second ridge at half the period, and identify 62 targets as mostly binary stars, RR Lyr, or beta Cep instead of delta Scuti variables. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00405"&gt;Searching for stellar flares from low mass stars using ASKAP and TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Rigney et. al., 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-mass stars can often produce flares and superflares with energies of up to 10&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt; ergs, and potentially even higher. In turn, these flares can produce coronal mass ejections, which are notoriously difficult to confirm on stars other than the Sun. Bursts of radio emissions, in particular at low frequencies, can provide a powerful method to detect flares and coronal mass ejections in low-mass stars, and shed light on the emission mechanisms responsible for these events. This paper presents the observations and analysis of four known active M dwarfs in the Southern hemisphere. Rigney et al. (2022) observed the targets with the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder Telescope and combined the data with the simultaneous TESS photometry from Sector 36 to detect variable radio emissions. The authors found no optical flares in the TESS lightcurves for any of the targets, no polarization from CD-56 1023A and TIC 55497266, strong circular polarization from WOH S 2, and weak circularly-polarized radio bursts from HD 270712. Further combined radio and optical observations are needed to constrain the mechanisms responsible for radio emission from low mass stars. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03989"&gt;Pterodactyls: A Tool to Uniformly Search and Vet for Young Transiting Planets In TESS Primary Mission Photometry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Fernandes et al., 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A comparison between young and old short-period planet populations provides valuable insights into the mechanisms responsible for evolutionary features such as the radius valley and the hot Neptune desert. Major challenges for the detection of young short-period transiting planets are astrophysical and systematics effects such as stellar variability and instrumental artifacts. This paper presents a new pipeline, Pterodactyls, which builds upon available tools and is designed to extract, detrend, search, and vet young transiting planets detected in the 30-min TESS photometry. Fernandes et al. use the pipeline to search for transiting planets in Tucana-Horologium Assocation, IC 2602, Upper Centaurus Lupus, Ursa Major and Pisces Eridani. The authors recovered eight of the ten known planets and planet candidates, found additional 15 transiting signals produced by eclipising binaries, and computed a planet occurrence rate of 49+/-20%. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02825"&gt;Determining Which Binary Component Hosts the TESS Transiting Planet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Lester et al., 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many planet candidates reside in binary or higher-order systems. Determining which of the component stars in such systems hosts a planet candidate cannot be achieved from transit photometry alone and further analysis is requred. Here, Lester et al. use speckle imaging observations from Gemini, WYIN, and SOAR to study 23 binary systems hosting transiting planet candidates from TESS. The authors identify the host component in each system by combining the transit photometry from TESS with the ground-based observations, and determine the true transit depths, planet radius and mean density. They found that most of the planet candidates in their sample orbit the primary stars (~70%), in two systems, the host is the secondary star, and in 5 out of the 23 systems, the host is uncertain. These results have important implications both for studies of exoplanet demographics and for future direct-imaging observations of planets in well-resolved binary systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.040711"&gt;TESS Shines Light on the Origin of the Ambiguous Nuclear Transient ASASSN-18el&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Hinkle et. al.,  2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) vary both photometrically and spectroscopically, and can exhibit extreme flaring events such as tidal disruptions, accretion rate changes, or ambiguous nuclear transients (ANTs). The latter are often difficult to classify due to lack of expected features or the presence of unexpected features. This paper presents a detailed analysis of ASASSN-18el ANT using data from ASASSN, ATLAS, TESS, NICER, and several ground-based observations. The peculiar observational behaviour of ASASSN-18el has been attributed to either to instabilities in the AGN, or to increased accretion due to tidal discuption. Hinkle et al. find that (i) the optical transient emission from ASASSN-18el remains detectable until at least 1250 days after peak; (ii) the initial decline is flatter than the power-law expected from tidal disruption events; (iii) the TESS data shows strong variability on timescales of weeks; (iv) there is a multi-wavelength plateau during the TESS-NICER overlap. Based on their analysis, the authors argue that the flare in ASASSN-18el is likely due to a large AGN flare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08560"&gt;Weak evidence for variable occultation depth of 55 Cnc e with TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Meier Valdes et al., 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At V = 6 mag, 55 Cnc is one of the brightest stars hosting exoplanets. One of its exoplanets, 55 Cnc e, was discovered with the radial velocity method and later shown to be not only transiting its host star, but also being occulted by it. The planet has an orbital period of 0.73 days, radius of 2 R⊕, and mass of 8 M⊕. Interestingly, the occultation depth of 55 Cnc e changes significantly in the infrared. This paper confirms the detection of the occultations in TESS, reports an occultation depth in the TESS bandpass of 15+/-4 parts-per-million (ppm) in Sector 21, 8+/-5 ppm in Sector 46. The Meier Valdes et al. detect no occultation in Sector 44 and present weak evidence for variable occultation depth in TESS data. The measured transit depths do not vary between the different sectors. The authors note that the process causing the variable occultation depth is still unknown, and suggest an upper limit of 0.4 on the geometric albedo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professional and amateurs astronomers have been collaborating for centuries. Over the past two decades, large-scale efforts have involved the participation of millions of citizen-scientists in projects ranging from astronomy to zoology, and everything in-between. This paper presents the Visual Survey Group (VSG) -- a dedicated team focused on analyzing data from Kepler, K2 and TESS. Over the past decade, the group has visually surveyed nearly 10 million lightcurves and authored 72 papers on the discovery and characterization of transiting exoplanets, eclipsing binary stars, multistellar systems, variable stars, rare events, etc. Amongst the highlights of the VSG contributions are several multiplanet systems, circumbinary planets, planets in young star clusters, random transmitters, KIC 8462852, potential exocomet transits, etc. The authors note that they are open to new collaborations and invite other researches to join the VSG. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main-sequence stars display two regimes of magnetic activity: a saturated regime independent of the rotation period up to a critical value, and an unsaturated regime where the activity decreases as the rotation period increases. The corresponding physical mechanisms and age-dependence are currently not firmly-established. This paper presents a study of the relationship between magnetic activity, kinematic age, and rotation rates of fully-convective M-dwarfs within 15 parsecs. Medina et al. combine TESS photometry, spectroscopic observations from TRES and CHIRON, and galactic velocities to show that their target sample exhibit a common power-law exponent for flare frequency distribution of alpha = 1.984+/-0.019, consistent with previous studies of a smaller sampler. Assuming constant star formation in the thin disk over the past 8 Gyr, the authors estimate that the stars in their sample transition between the saturated and unsaturated flaring regime at an average age of 2.4 Gyr. This would have important implications for the atmospheres of planets orbiting these stars. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02501"&gt;The Discovery of a Planetary Companion Interior to Hot Jupiter WASP-132 b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Hord et al., 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hot Jupiters are predominantly lonely. At the time of writing, only three out of the ~500 confirmed transiting Hot Jupiters have known companions (WASP-47, Kepler-730 and TOI-1130). This paper presents the discovery and validation of WASP-132 c, a planetary companion interior to the orbit of the Hot Jupiter WASP-132 b. WASP-132 c has a radius of 12.0 R⊕, and an orbital period of 1.01 days. Hord et al. combined TESS photometry, ground-based archival and follow-up observations, and vetting and validation tools to rule out common false positives and confirm the planetary nature of the companion. Spectroscopic measurements from the CORALIE spectrograph place a 3 sigma upper limit of 37.35 M⊕ for the mass of WASP-132 c. Such systems provide deeper understanding of the connection between planet formation and the observed population. The authors of the paper suggest that the presence of WASP-132 c argues against a high-eccentricity migration scenario for the formation of the Hot Jupiter WASP-132 b. See Fig. 1 below and the paper for more details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03934"&gt;Multiply eclipsing candidates from the TESS satellite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Zasche, Henzl &amp;amp; Masek, 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eclipsing binary stars represent ideal astrophysical laboratories to study basic stellar properties such as mass, radius, luminosity, etc. In turn, large-scale photometric surveys such as TESS provide unique opportunity to study eclipsing binaries in triple and higher-order stellar systems. A particularly interesting subset of such systems are quadruple stars with a 2+2 hierarchical configuration where each binary pair is eclipsing. Zasche et al. used TESS data to discover 25 triply-eclipsing triple stars and 116 doubly-eclipsing quadruple stars. Some of the targets exhibit eclipse-time variations indicating possible period changes and relatively short mutual orbital periods. The authors also suggest that V0871 Can is a potential septuple star with a (Aa+Ab)+B+C+D configuration. These systems bring important new insight into the formation mechanism of stars in multiple systems. They also enable ``real time'' studies of orbital evolution, Kozai-Lidov oscillations, precession and inclination changes, etc. See Fig. 2 below and the paper for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors present their analysis of two magnetic cataclysmic variable stars (CVs), SDSS J084617.11+245344.1 and Paloma. These are very-short period binary systems composed of a white dwarf and a main sequence star (usually M-dwarf) that interact with each other via accretion flows from the latter to the former. At the time of writing, there are only a handful of confirmed asynchronous polar magnetic CVs with continuous, long-duration photometric observations. TESS observed Paloma, a rare intermediate-asynchronous hybrid polar, in short-cadence during Sector 19, and helped confirm that the spin period is 2.27 hours, resolving a previous ambiguity between 2.27 hours and 2.43 hours. The TESS lightcurve is shown in Fig. 3 below. Based on the TESS data, Littlefield et al. argue that Paloma experiences either pole switching or a grazing eclipse of one of the emitting regions, and suggest that future observations are needed to discern between the two scenarios. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10613"&gt;Photometric Investigation of Contact Binary DY Cet Based on TESS Data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Yildirim 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DY Cet is a 3.77 Gyr contact binary classified as a W UMa type system. In these systems both stars fill or even overfill their inner Roche lobe, with components surrounded by a common envelope and the system overall being far from sphericity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors present the photometric analysis of TESS data for DY Cet which was observed in Sector 4 with a 120 second cadence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilizing a combination of the TESS light curve and the published radial velocity data, the masses and radii of the system components were derived as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Star 1: M =  1.55  M⊙, R = 1.51 R⊙&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Star 2: M2= 0.55  M⊙, R = 0.95 R⊙&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The degree of contact is 23% and the mass ratio 0.355. The orbital period derived from the data indicates a sinus-like change with decreasing parabola. A mass transfer between the two components is used to explain the orbital period change. This mass transfer is considered conservative at dM/dt = 1.1 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; M⊙ yr&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. The sinus-like change is thought to be caused by a third component with a mass of 0.13 M⊙. Please read the paper to find out more about this fascinating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15365"&gt;High-mass pulsators in eclipsing binaries observed using TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Southworth and Bowman,  2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TESS mission has been very useful in the observation of massive stars, enabling study into pulsations and binarity. By studying pulsating massive stars in eclipsing binary systems, we may gain a better understanding of stellar structure and evolution history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors have used TESS observations to study 18 high mass eclipsing binaries which show intrinsic variability.  The authors modelled the TESS light curves, removing the effects of binarity to derive physical properties. Mass and radii measurements were obtained for δ Cir, CC Cas, SZ Cam V436 Per and V539 Ara. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residual light curves were searched for pulsation signatures and of the 18, six displayed definite β Cephei pulsation, and eight possible. Additionally, seven showed stochastic low-frequency variability, and eight showed signs of possible pulsating B star pulsation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15826"&gt;The TESS Triple-9 Catalog: 999 uniformly vetted candidate exoplanets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Cacciapuoti et al., 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2018 the TESS mission has detected 1000's of exoplanet candidates, of these only 205 (to date) have been confirmed, vetting of false positives is therefore critical. In this work the authors present the TESS Triple-9 (TT9) catalog, a uniformly vetted catalog containing the qualities of 999 exoplanet candidates listed on ExoFOP-TESS, known as TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The catalog was produced using the Discovery And Vetting of Exoplanets pipeline (DAVE), and was part of the Citizen Science project &lt;a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/marckuchner/planet-patrol"&gt;Planet Patrol&lt;/a&gt;. Of the TOI's listed in the TT9 catalog 70% pass diagnostic tests and are therefore marked as true planetary candidates. There were 144 objects classified as false candidates, and an additional 146 as potential false positives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TT9 catalog contains ~20% of the entire ExoFOP-TESS TOIs list and it demonstrates the synergy between automated tools and citizen science projects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers to our latest news bulletin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we highlight some of the more recent papers from the archive, we would like to introduce you to the two newest members of our team - Dr. Christina Hedges and Dr. Veselin Kostov. View our &lt;a href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/helpdesk.html"&gt;Help Desk&lt;/a&gt; for more information about TESS GI team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now on to the papers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07178"&gt;TOI-3757 b: A low density gas giant orbiting a solar-metallicity M dwarf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Kanodia et. al., 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new Jovian sized planet has been discovered by TESS, and confirmed using precise radial velocities from HPF and NED. The planet has been given the designation TOI-3757b and is the lowest density planet orbiting an M dwarf (a solar metallicity M0V star). The planet has a radius of 12.0 R⊕ and mass of 85.3 M⊕ making it one of roughly 10 known gas giants around M-dwarfs, and one which has a low density of ρ= 0.27 g cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of the paper state that the low density could be due either to the low metallicity of the host star, which may have delayed the formation of a solid core massive enough to initiate runaway accretion; or given its eccentricity (e = 0.14) significant tidal heating may have occurred, inflating the radius. See this fascinating paper for more details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05901"&gt;Gaia0007-1605: an old triple system with an inner brown dwarf-white dwarf binary and an outer white dwarf companion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Rebassa-Mansergas et. al.,  2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaia0007-1605AC is the first inner brown dwarf-white dwarf binary of a hierarchical triple system in which the outer component is another white dwarf, know as Gaia0007-1605B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using optical/near-IR spectroscopy from the Very Large Telescope (X-Shooter), Gaia photometry, and SED fitting, the authors of this paper have determined the effective temperatures and masses of the white dwarfs in the system as 12018 K and 0.54 M&lt;sub&gt;sun&lt;/sub&gt; for Gaia0007-1605A and 4445 K and 0.56 M&lt;sub&gt;sun&lt;/sub&gt; for Gaia0007-1605B. The brown dwarf has and effective temperature of 1850 K which means it has a spectral type of L3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TESS light curve was used to determine a signal of 1.0446 days for Gaia0007-1605AC, with an amplitude of 6.25 ppt. This signal is interpreted as the orbital period modulated from irradiation effects of the white dwarf on the brown dwarf's surface. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper goes on to discuss the evolution of the inner binary and the system as a whole, which is estimated to be about 10 Gyr old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02694"&gt;TOI-1696: a nearby M4 dwarf with a 3R⊕ planet in the Neptunian desert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Mori et. al.,  2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors present their discovery of temperate sub-Neptune around its M-dwarf host TOI-1696. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using TESS data, in addition to followup ground-based observations, the radius of the planet was determined as 3.09 R⊕ and its orbital period as 2.5days. The mass of the planet is estimated as 48.8M⊕ and was determined from radial velocities measured by IRD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stellar parameters were determined using spectroscopic observations: Type = M4 dwarf, T&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; = 3185 K, and  metallicity = 0.336 dex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional observations from several facilities also led the authors to determine that there are no stellar companions or background sources to the star. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The planet belonging to the Neptunian desert with the highest transmission spectroscopy metric discovered to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers to our latest news bulletin. This week we feature three new papers from the archive, enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00221"&gt;Hitting a New Low: The Unique 28 h Cessation of Accretion in the TESS Light Curve of YY Dra (DO Dra)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Hill et. al., 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YY Draconis is an intermediate Polar which has been observed by TESS. A power spectrum of the system indicates that there is stream fed accretion most of the time except for a day in 2020 when it entered a flat-bottomed low state during which the only periodic signal was ellipsoidal variation and there was no substantial flickering. The authors believe that this low state was cased by a halt in the accretion, something that has been observed only once before in an intermediate polar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ground based observations taken at the same time indicate that when there is little to no accretion the system fades to 17.37 mag in g-band. This brightness comes from the white dwarf and its red dwarf companion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional observations of YY Draconis by other ground-based facilities in 2018-2019 also indicate fading of the system, but not to the low extent observed by TESS. All observations however suggest relatively frequent halts in the accretion for this system. See this fascinating paper for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12747"&gt;Revisiting WASP-47 with ESPRESSO and TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Bryant et. al.,  2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WASP-47 is a planetary system which is home to the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WASP-47 b: A hot Jupiter with a period of 4.159 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WASP-47 c: A giant planet with a long period of 588.4 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WASP-47 d: An outer Neptune with a period of 9.031 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WASP-47 e: A super-Earth with a period of 0.7896 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observations of WASP-47 by TESS were used to refine the orbital ephemerides of the transiting planets in the system, specifically for WASP-47 b there is a 17.4 min shift in the transit time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measurements from the ESPRESSO spectrograph were also used to obtain a new radial velocity for the system, which was used to refine the masses of both WASP-47 d and e. For WASP-47 e the mass was derived as 6.77 M⊕ and it has a bulk density of 6.29 gcm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally the authors used K2 data to detect a periodic modulation that corresponds to a 32.5 day stellar rotation. See this paper for more information about this multi-planet system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10182"&gt;Validation and atmospheric exploration of the sub-Neptune TOI-2136b around a nearby M3 dwarf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Kawauchi et al., 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors study a new sub-Neptune sized planet candidate TOI-2136.01 which orbits a nearby M dwarf (located 33.36 pc away and has an effective temperature of 3373 K) with an orbital period of 7.852 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TOI-2136.01, now known as  TOI-2136b, was validated as a planet using TESS data, ground-based multi-color photometry, and radial velocity measurements with the InfraRed Doppler (IRD) instrument on the Subaru Telescope. Stellar and planetary parameters were also derived from these data, with a planetary radius of 2.2 R⊕ and mass of 4.7 M⊕ obtained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The atmosphere of the planet was investigated using high-resolution transmission spectroscopy, focusing on  helium 10830 Å absorption lines.  Through their studies the authors place an upper limit on the equivalent width of &amp;lt; 7.8 mÅ (95 % confidence) and on the absorption signal of &amp;lt; 1.44 % (95 % confidence).  Read this paper for more information of this new sub-Neptune. &lt;/p&gt;

Top: Overlaid ASAS-SN (blue circles) and ZTF (green triangles) light curves with including a deep low state observed by TESS shown in the cyan shaded region. The ASAS-SN light curve is relatively uniform for the first few years. However, multiple intermittent low states begin to appear around 2018-2019. The observed low states reach a consistent minimum magnitude. Bottom-left: The DASCH light curve, with detections shown as circles and non-detections as dashes. As explained in the text, non-detections with limits brighter than magnitude 15 have been excluded. The quiescent magnitude is comparable to that observed by ZTF. While there are numerous outbursts throughout the observational period, no low states comparable to those in the ASAS-SN and ZTF data are present. Bottom right: Enlargement of the ZTF observations obtained during the TESS light curve. The faintest datum (g = 17.37 ± 0.12) was obtained during the deep low state, when accretion was negligible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This week we are looking at three papers from the archive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06964"&gt;Planet Hunters TESS IV: A massive, compact hierarchical triple star system TIC 470710327&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Eisner et. al., 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors report on the discovery of a massive, compact, hierarchical triple system known as TIC 470710327. This system was originally identified by citizen scientists as part of the &lt;a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/nora-dot-eisner/planet-hunters-tess"&gt;Planet Hunters&lt;/a&gt; project which asks the community to search for transiting events in TESS data. After identification it was then observed by the HERMES spectrograph and these data combined with eclipse timing variations confirmed that the system consists of three OB stars, with a compact 1.1 day eclipsing binary and a non-eclipsing tertiary with a 52.04 day orbit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using radial velocity measurements and the eclipsing timing variations dynamical modeling was performed which indicated a rare configuration where the tertiary star is more massive than the combined mass of the inner binary. The tertiary star is thought to be an O9.5 -B0.5V star with a mass between 14-17 M⊙, and the inner binary is thought to be between 10.9 - 13.2 M⊙. It is likely therefore that the system will undergo multiple stages of mass transfer in the future and may end up as a double neutron star gravitational wave progenitor or an exotic Thorne-Zytkow object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05790"&gt;97 Eclipsing Quadruple Star Candidates Discovered in TESS Full Frame Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Kostov et. al.,  2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper presents a catalog of 97 carefully vetted quadruple star systems. These systems were identified in the TESS full frame images from Sectors 1 through 42 via machine learning techniques and visual examination, with major contributions from a group of citizen scientists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each target has two sets of eclipses with two different periods,  both of which pass photocenter tests confirming that the eclipses are on-target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sample presented here nearly doubles the number of known multiply-eclipsing quadruple systems, and will aid significantly in future studies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the creation of the catalog the authors made several important discoveries, including finding the first sextuply-eclipsing sextuple stellar system and the first transiting circumbinary planet detected from one sector of TESS data. See this paper for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03895"&gt;Searching for white dwarf variables in TESS data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Priyatikanto, 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crossmatching a sample of four thousand Gaia sources with apparent G-band magnitudes brighter than 17th, and trigonometric parallaxes greater than 3.33 milli-arcseconds, to TESS higher level science products and full frame images the authors of this paper were able to extract the light curves of possible white dwarf variables. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most targets were observed in at least one sector and with a 30 minute cadence. Using a Lomb-Scargle periodogram constructed from de-trended light curves, 634 white dwarfs were found to have periodic variability. See this paper for more information about the sources identified. &lt;/p&gt;

This week we are looking at three papers from the archive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.13274"&gt;TOI-1442 b and TOI-2445 b: two ultra-short period super-Earths around M dwarfs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Morello et. al., 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an exoplanet has an orbit of less than a day it is known as an ultra short period (USP) planet and they are relatively rare. To date 120 USP planets have been confirmed with this paper adding another two, both discovered by TESS. 
The UPS planets discussed here are TOI-1442 b and TOI-2445 b, which have been examined using light-curves from both TESS and ground-based facilities in addition to radial velocity measurements from Subaru/IRD. These data were used to confirm the planetary natue of the objects and to obtain their physical properties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TOI-1442 b is a hot super-Earth with an orbital period of 0.409 days, a radius of 1.27R⊕, equilibrium temperature of 1359 K, and a mass less than 18M⊕. 
 TOI-2445 b is a hot super-Earth/mini-Neptune with an orbital period of 0.371 days, a radius of 1.52R⊕, equilibrium temperature of 1332 K, and a mass less than 38M⊕.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.13341"&gt;TOI-1268b: the youngest hot Saturn-mass transiting exoplanet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Šubjak et. al.,  2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors report on the discovery of Saturn-mass planet known as TOI-1268b orbiting a K-dwarf host star. The planet is the youngest Saturn-mass planet know to date with an age of ~1Gyr. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The planet has an eccentric orbit with e = 0.092, an orbital period of 8.158 days. Combining TESS data with high-resolution spectra from the Tautenburg and Ondrejov observatories the authors derive a mass of 96.4 M⊕ and a radius of 9.1 R⊕.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The host star has a mass of 0.96 M⊙, a radius of 0.92 R⊙, an effective temperature of 5300 K, and a metallicity of 0.36 dex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00970"&gt;Discovery and mass measurement of the hot, transiting, Earth-sized planet GJ 3929 b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Kemmer et al., 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GJ 3929 b is a hot Earth sized planet which orbits an M3.5 V dwarf star with a J-band magnitude of 8.7, which was observed in TESS sectors 24 and 25. Using these TESS data in combination with spectra from CARMENES and additional transit follow-up observations from SAINT-EX, LCOGT, and OSN, the authors determine a planet radius of 1.150 R⊕, a mass of 1.21 M⊕, an orbital period of 2.62 days, and a density of 4.4 g cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;. This density is similar to that of the Earth's mean density at ~5.5  g cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The radial velocity data of the system also indicated that there may be another planet in the system with an orbital period of 14.3 days. See the paper for more information about the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers!
This week we are looking at three papers from the archive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04158"&gt;Discovery of 74 new bright ZZ Ceti stars in the first three years …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;STATUS UPDATE: Orbit 2 of Sector 26 and orbit 1 of Sector 27 are now available to download as TICA products from MAST.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers!
This week we are looking at three papers from the archive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04158"&gt;Discovery of 74 new bright ZZ Ceti stars in the first three years of TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Romero et. al., 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZZ Ceti stars are cool pulsating white dwarfs, in this paper the authors report on the discovery of 74 such stars using TESS data. The variable stars were discovered in Sectors 1 through 39 of the TESS mission, utilizing both the 120-second and 20-second cadence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sample contains objects from both the northern and southern hemispheres, and consists of 13 low-mass and one very low-mass white dwarf candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eleven of the objects were followed up using ground-based telescopes, allowing for the detection of a larger number of periods. The spectra obtained were used for period and asteroseismological analysis, from which the authors estimated the stellar mass, effective temperature and hydrogen envelope mass of the sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mean asteroseismological mass of ~ 0.635 M⊙ was derived upon exclusion of the extream candidates, and is within agreement of the mean mass estimated from both Gaia data (0.631 M⊙), and the previously known ZZ Cetis mass (0.644 M⊙).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inclusion of the authors sample has increased the number of know ZZ Cetis by 20%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04146"&gt;The TESS-Keck Survey. VIII. Confirmation of a Transiting Giant Planet on an Eccentric 261 day Orbit with the Automated Planet Finder Telescope&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Dalba et. al.,  2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citizen scientists have discovered a giant 2.8 M&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt; planet, now known as TOI-2180 b, orbiting a slightly evolved G5 host star in Cycle 2 of the TESS mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transit observed lasted 24 hrs and upon further followup (via the Automated Planet Finder telescope at the Lick Observatory) radial velocity measurements indicated an orbital period of 260.8 days with an orbital eccentricity of 0.368. These follow-up observations also indicated long-term acceleration from a more distant massive companion. A campaign was then launched in which 14 ground-based observatories were used to search for another transit, but no transit was confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors then used  giant planet structure models to retrieve the bulk heavy-element content of the detected planet. For more information about this fascinating system and the work conducted please see the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04197"&gt;A Mirage or an Oasis? Water Vapor in the Atmosphere of the Warm Neptune TOI-674 b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Brande et al., 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TOI-674 b was discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and is a super-Neptune with a radii of 5.25 R⊕ and a mass of 23.6 M⊕. The planet is located deep in the Neptune desert, a region in which Neptune sized planets have short orbital periods, and likely complex evolutionary histories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using G141 grism on the HST the authors obtain near-infrared transmission spectroscopy of the planets atmosphere in order to identify which absorbers are present. The data indicates increased absorption at 1.4  μm due to water vapor at 2.1σ, and as such this planet is now one of few with featured transmission spectra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TESS data are used in combination of that from  Spitzer/IRAC to re-derived the transit parameters with measurements of Rp/R∗=0.1135, T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=2458544.523792 BJD, and P=1.977198 days obtained. &lt;/p&gt;

This week we are looking at three papers from the archive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02515"&gt;The transiting planetary system WASP-86/KELT-12: TESS provides the casting vote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Southworth et. al., 2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016/2017 two teams independently published their discovery of a transiting planetary system. This system is known as WASP-86 (Faedi et al. 2016) by one team and KELT-12 (Stevens et al. 2017) by the other. 
In each paper the teams derive very different system parameters, with the most noticeable being a factor of three difference in the measured radius of the planet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using data from TESS, the authors of this paper have derived new system parameters finding a stellar mass of 1.278 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt; and a stellar radius of 2.02 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;. 
The planetary mass was also estimated as 0.833 M&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt; with a radius of 1.382 R&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors state that the discrepancy between parameters presented in earlier papers was caused by a "disagreement over the transit depth and duration". The authors then go on to explain that this inaccuracy was caused by the transit being long and shallow and as such not suitable for follow-up photometry from ground-based telescopes. See this paper for more information about the dual named system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01713"&gt;TIC-320687387 B: a long-period eclipsing M-dwarf close to the hydrogen burning limit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Gill et. al.,  2022)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TIC-320687387 is a bright (TESS&lt;sub&gt;mag&lt;/sub&gt;=11.6)  G-dwarf star observed by TESS in Sectors 13 and 17, and seen to have a single transit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using data from CORALIE, the Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS), and Lesedi the authors of this paper have determined that the transiting object, TIC-320687387 B, is a low mass star with a mass of 96.2.M&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, radius of 1.14 R&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, period of 29.77381 days, and eccentricity of 0.366.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given its mass and radius TIC-320687387 B is close to the hydrogen burning limit ∼80M&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;. The fact that a system like TIC-320687387 AB exits also allows scientists to test stellar evolution models for low-mass stars, which are needed to calculate accurate masses and radii for exoplanets orbiting single low-mass stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02516"&gt;Rediscussion of eclipsing binaries. Paper VIII. The doubly-eclipsing quadruple star system V498 Cygni&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Southworth 2022b)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using TESS data the authors of this paper have discovered a second set of eclipses for V498 Cyg, an early B-type binary which has eclipses with a period of 3.48 days and possesses two sets of spectral lines. 
The second set of newly discovered eclipses have a 1.44 d period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the development of a model the authors were able to simultaneously fit the properties of both eclipsing binaries, and whilst the fainter system is fit well, the brighter system is not. The model is unable to reproduced the asymmetric primary eclipse or its changing light curve shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TESS data was used to determine the orbital ephemerides and the physical properties of the stars with the masses of the brighter binary being  M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt; and 11 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, and the fainter binary as 6.5 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt; and 3.5 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Happy new year TESS followers!  In 2022 we look forward to yet another a year full of TESS science.
This week we are looking at three papers from the archive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aay3253"&gt;GJ 367b: A dense, ultrashort-period sub-Earth planet transiting a nearby red dwarf star&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Lam et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GJ 367 is a cool M-dwarf planet located 9.41 pc from our Sun with a V-band magnitude of 10.2. Using TESS data scientists have discovered a planet orbiting this dwarf with a 7.7 hr period, making it an ultrashort-period exoplanet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stellar properties were obtained using the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) and are as follows:  T&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; = 3519 K, mass = 0.454 M⊙, radius 0.457 R⊙, and luminosity 0.0288 L⊙.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The properties of the planet, GJ 367b, were derived using data from a variety of facilities.  Transit measurements indicated a radius of 0.718 R⊕, and radial velocity measurements indicated a mass of 0.546 M⊕. This makes the body a sub-Earth exoplanet with a bulk density of 8.106 g cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;, close to that of pure iron. Using a neural network the interior structure of the planet was investigated with final results predicting that the planet has an iron core radius fraction of 86%,  a &amp;lt;10% water ice and/or a H and He gas envelope, and a silicate mantle - all of which make the planet similar in composition to that of Mercury. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the planets close proximity to its host it receives a substantial amount of stellar irradiation, approximately 576 times that which we receive her on Earth. The day side temperature of GJ 367b is therefore 1745 K which would be enough to evaporate any sort of early atmosphere, in addition to vaporizing or melting silicates or metallic iron. Please see the fascinating Science paper for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-021-01531-9"&gt;Polarimetric detection of non-radial oscillation modes in the β Cephei star β Crucis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Cotton et. al.,  2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;β Cephei stars are high mass stars ( 8–25 M⨀) that are seismically active and as such they pulsate. The pulsation modes of these stars are however of low radial order and do not have recognizable frequency patterns, which makes mode assignment difficult and as such asteroseismic inference of the stellar interior. Understanding these stars is of vital importance since they are the progenitors of core-collapse supernovae and black holes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to a lack of high cadenced data in multiple bands, obtaining modes and increasing our understanding has been difficult. In this paper detailed TESS observations of β Crucis have been combined together with data from WISE, AAT (linear polarimetric observations), and other facilities to carry out a joint frequency analysis. This analysis revealed two modes in β Cru with small polarimetric amplitudes and several further modes which are predicted to have polarimetric amplitudes just below the detection threshold. , β Crucis is now the highest-mass β Cep star with such asteroseismic information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through their study the authors  have confirmed the 40-year-old predictions of pulsation-induced polarization variability and its utility in asteroseismology for mode identification, see this Nature paper for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13448"&gt;TOI 560 : Two Transiting Planets Orbiting a K Dwarf Validated with iSHELL, PFS and HIRES RVs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Mufti et. al.,  2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors validate the presence of a system with two planets, TOI 560. This system consists of a 0.2-1.4 Gyr K4 dwarf, a moderately eccentric (e=0.294) transiting mini-Neptune (TOI 560 b) with a period of 6.397438, and a transiting mini-Neptune (TOI 560 c) with a period of 18.8779 days. Both planets were discovered using TESS data and the resonance derived as 1:3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the examination of data from TESS, Spitzer, and other ground-based facilities, the ephemerides and period of the transiting planets were derived. Follow-up spectroscopy and radial velocities were obtained with iSHELL  and HIRES and used to derive the masses of the two planets as M&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 2.1 M&lt;sub&gt;Nep&lt;/sub&gt;, and M&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 4.1 M&lt;sub&gt;Nep&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information about this system and the stellar activity of the host star please read this paper. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fig. 1:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Taken from Lam et. al., (2021). Masses and radii of small planets (&amp;lt; 2 R⊕) that have both quantities measured with precision ≤30%.Symbols indicate masses determined with RVs (circles) and transit timing variations (triangles), Solar System planets (diamonds), and GJ 367b (star). Error bars show 1-sigma uncertainties. Exoplanet symbols are color coded according to the equilibrium dayside temperatures (color bar). Theoretical mass-radius relations for two-layer rocky planets are shown with lines corresponding to different core mass fractions. These cores consist of pure iron, pure rock (100% MgSiO3), or a two-layer core with a mixture of iron and rock or rock and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ice, as indicated in the legend. The solid red line denotes the lower limit on planet radius after collisional stripping. GJ 367b is likely an iron-dominated planet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fig. 2:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Taken from Cotton et. al., (2021). The amplitude spectrum derived from the TESS time series for f ∈ [0, 8] d−1. Colored vertical lines illustrate the two oscillation modes with the largest amplitudes; other frequencies are not obvious in the amplitude spectrum until prewhitening has been performed. b, The amplitude spectra derived from the TESS time series (in black), after prewhitening for f1 and f3. Peak locations are identified by colored vertical lines. The horizontal dotted line indicates SNR = 4. c, The TESS amplitude spectrum after 23 identified modes have been prewhitened, as discussed in the text. While some peaks remain at the &amp;lt;0.1 ppt level, none of these reaches our required significance level. d, The amplitude spectrum from HIPPI-2 Q/I polarimetry. The complex quasiperiodic structure visible is due to diurnal (and other) aliasing and illustrates the value of using multiple datasets to determine which peaks are ‘real’. Here the red and grey vertical lines mark the two detected oscillation modes in this dataset, while the matching dotted lines show the locations of predicted ± 1, 2, 3,... d−1 alias peaks. e, The same HIPPI-2 Q/I amplitude spectrum after prewhitening 23 frequencies. The U/I spectra are similar and are shown in Supplementary Fig. 2. Note: 1 ppt = 1000 ppm.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The light curves are shown as blue data points, and the cubic spline regression is shown as the pink line. The interpolation in the data gap downlink region in the middle of each sector is subsequently discarded in our analysis. Significant photometric modulation due to stellar activity is apparent in both sectors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="news"></category></entry><entry><title>TESS activities at AGU</title><link href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/tess-activities-at-agu.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-12-06T10:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-12-06T10:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Rebekah Hounsell</name></author><id>tag:heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov,2021-12-06:/docs/tess/tess-activities-at-agu.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The TESS team is looking forward to attending the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.agu.org/Fall-Meeting"&gt;AGU fall meeting&lt;/a&gt; meeting in New Orleans next week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers!  This week we are looking at three papers from the archive, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00198"&gt;TOI-1842b: A Transiting Warm Saturn Undergoing Re-Inflation around an Evolving Subgiant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Wittenmyer et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers!  This week we are looking at three papers from the archive, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00198"&gt;TOI-1842b: A Transiting Warm Saturn Undergoing Re-Inflation around an Evolving Subgiant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Wittenmyer et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TESS in addition to several additional ground based telescopes (Minerva-Australis, NRES, and the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope) has identified and confirmed the presence of a warm Saturn orbiting TOI-1842. The planet, known as TOI-1842b, has a radius of 1.04 R&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;, a mass of 0.214 M&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;, an orbital period of 9.5739 days, a transit duration of 4.3 hrs, and a very low density of 0.252 g cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interesting thing about the TOI-184 system is that the host star is evolving off its main sequence, as such it presents an excellent opportunity to test models of gas giant re-inflation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00028"&gt;A 2+1+1 quadruple star system containing the most eccentric, low-mass, short-period, eclipsing binary known&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Han et. al.,  2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors discuss a 2+1+1 quadruple system that they discovered with TESS. This system contains an unresolved eclipsing binary which is part of TIC 121088960, and a close neighbor TIC 121088959. The eclipsing binary has two very low-mass M dwarf stars which are in a highly eccentric short period orbit with e = 0.709 and P = 3.04358 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TIC 121088959 and TIC 121088960 are separated by only 3.9", this combined with the fact that one TESS detector pixel is equivalent to 21 arcseconds on sky, meant that determining the likelihood of the eclipsing binary being part of TIC 121088960 was difficult. To do this the authors used a light centroiding analysis of the difference image between in-eclipse and out of eclipse data. This method did indeed indicate that eclipsing binary is part of TIC 121088960, but  that it only contributes ∼10% of its light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional facilities (iSHELL at NASA's Infrared Facility and the Coudé spectrograph at the McDonald 2.7-m telescope) were used to obtain radial velocity measurements which indicated no variation over the 11-day observation period. The radial velocity differences between the two images was measured as 8 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, and similar distances and proper motions were derived from the images indicating that TIC 121088959 and TIC 121088960 are a gravitationally bound pair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examining Gaia's large RUWE and astrometric_excess_noise parameters for TIC 121088960 also suggested that the eclipsing binary is part of the system and that it is itself a triple star. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the conduction of an SED analysis the masses of all four stars were derived with the eclipsing binary stars having masses of  0.19 M⊙ and 0.14 M⊙, and the two visible 0.43 M⊙ and 0.39 M⊙, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using numerical simulations the authors also found that the orbital period of the inner triple is likely the range of 1 to 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15028"&gt;The Solar Neighborhood XLIX: Nine Giant Planets Orbiting Nearby K Dwarfs, and the CHIRON Spectrograph's Radial Velocity Performance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Paredes et. al.,  2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three new exoplanet candidates orbiting K dwarfs have been identified by the authors as part of their K dwarf survey. A hot Jupiter from TESS was also  confirmed which orbits TOI 129.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work was conducted as part of a larger radial velocity survey of K dwarfs up to 50 pc away. The survey aimed to look for stellar, brown dwarf, and jovian planets using radial velocities from the CHIRON spectrograph on the CTIO/SMARTS 1.5m telescope. The techniques employed by the authors to find their objects of interest were confirmed via the detection of five additional known exoplanets orbiting K dwarfs. This paper presents the nine orbital solutions derived, with each system hosting an exoplanet candidate with minimum masses between 0.5 - 3.0 M&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper also presents a list of 136 nearby K dwarfs which have V-band magnitudes of 7 - 12 and radial velocity precisions between 5 - 20 ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fig. 2:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Taken from Han et. al., (2021).  Light centroid for the primary eclipse (red cross) and secondary eclipse (orange cross). The locations of TIC 121088960 and TIC 121088959 are indicated as heavy filled circles on the plot. The arms on the crosses represent the ±1 − 𝜎 uncertainties on the light centroids, while the circles correspond to the 3 − 𝜎 range on the centroid locations. These demonstrate that the eclipses occur with a few arc seconds of the target stars. Specifically, the eclipses are distinctly closer to TIC 121088960 and rule against TIC 121088959 at the 2.9 𝜎 and 2.4 𝜎 level for the primary and secondary eclipses, respectively. The other two marked stars are at &amp;gt; 20 th magnitude.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="news"></category></entry><entry><title>TESS Weekly Bulletin: November 25th</title><link href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/tess-weekly-bulletin-november-25th.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-11-25T10:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-11-25T10:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Rebekah Hounsell</name></author><id>tag:heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov,2021-11-25:/docs/tess/tess-weekly-bulletin-november-25th.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;STATUS UPDATE: Orbit 2 of Sector 44 is now available to download as a TICA product from MAST&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers!  This week we are looking at three papers from the archive, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10074"&gt;Triply eclipsing triple stars in the northern TESS fields: TICs 193993801, 388459317 and 52041148&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Borkovits et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TESS has been used to find three new triply eclipsing triple star systems:  TICs 193993801, 388459317, and 52041148.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilizing the precision photometry provided by TESS in addition to other ground-based archival and follow-up observations, several of the systems parameters were derived or examined including: eclipse timing variations, spectral energy distributions, and theoretical evolutionary tracks which enabled the deduction of the system masses and orbital parameters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By searching for longer-term periodicity in archival  ASAS-SN photometry, the authors were able to find the orbital periods of the outer stars in each system, the values of which are 49.28 d, 89.86 d, and 177.0 d, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full photometric analysis of all three systems revealed that they are all coplanar to within 1-3 degrees, and that the outer eccentricities are 0.003, 0.10, and 0.62, respectively. Masses of the three stars in the three systems were also derived and are listed as follows: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TIC 193993801: 1.31, 1.19, 1.34 M ⊙&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TIC 388459317: 1.82, 1.73, 2.19 M ⊙&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TIC 52041148:  1.62, 1.48, 2.74 M ⊙&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where the masses listed denote the stars Aa, Ab, and B respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12074"&gt;TOI-2109b: An Ultrahot Gas Giant on a 16 hr Orbit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Wong et. al.,  2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors present the discovery of an Ultra hot Jupiter orbiting TOI-2109, an F-type star originally identified by TESS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The planet is found to orbit its host with a short period of  ~ 0.672 days (16 hrs) and has a radius of 1.347 R&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;. The planetary nature of the object was confirmed by radial velocity measurements and a mass of 5.02  M&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sup&gt; derived. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The host star has an effective temperature of ∼6500 K, a mass of 1.447 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, a radius of 1.698 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;, and a rotational velocity of vsini&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; =81.9±1.7 km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using spectroscopic transit information the Doppler shadow was examined and it was determined that the system is likely well-aligned with a sky-projected obliquity of λ=1:7±1:7. The TESS light curve indicated a secondary eclipse with a depth of 731 ppm, phase-curve variations from the planet's longitudinal brightness modulation, and the ellipsoidal distortion of the host star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combing the TESS observations with those from the ground, the authors found that the dayside emission of TOI-2109b is consistent with a brightness temperature of 3631 K. This temperature would make TOI-2109b the second hottest exoplanet discovered to date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12098"&gt;TIC 5724661: A Long-Period Binary with a Pulsating sdB Star and δ Scuti Variable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Jayaraman et. al.,  2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 20-second cadenced data provided by TESS has allowed for the detection of a unique binary system which is thought to consist of a δ  Scuti primary star and a hot subdwarf B (sdB) secondary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The δ Scuti star has pulsations over  32-41 d&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and shares what is thought to be a wide orbit with it secondary. This secondary star also has  large-amplitude p-mode pulsation at 524 d&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using radial velocity measurements of the  δ Scuti star the orbital period of the secondary must be at least 35 days, which is unusual for a sdB binary system. See this paper for more information about the system and how it might have formed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers!  This week we are looking at three papers from the archive, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01749"&gt;TOI-2257 b: A highly eccentric long-period sub-Neptune transiting a nearby M dwarf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Schanche et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors present the discovery of TOI-2257 b, a sub-Neptune planet around an M3 host star known as TIC 198485881 which is located 57.8 pc away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The planet has a transit depth of 0.4%, making ground-based followup observations possible. The duration of the planets orbit around its host would suggest a highly eccentric orbit with e ~0.5, which would make it the most eccentric planet known to be transiting an M-dwarf star. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilizing both TESS and ground-based data (observations from the 1.0-m SAINT-EX, 0.60-m TRAPPIST-North and 1.2-m FLWO telescopes) the authors determined that the planet has a radius of 2.2 R⊕, and an orbital period of 35.19 days.
Additional data and packages are also used to confirm the authors planetary interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02416"&gt;TOI-712: a system of adolescent mini-Neptunes extending to the habitable zone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Vach et. al.,  2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TESS mission enables the detection of the rarest kinds of transiting exoplanets, including the youngest planets, and as such the mission enables the study of evolutionary processes. Utilizing TESS data the authors discovered a young, multi-planet system orbiting a K4.5V star known as TOI-712 which has a V-band magnitude of 10.838, a mass of 0.733 M⊙, a radius of 0.674 R⊙,  and an effective temperature of 4622 K.The TESS light curve indicated a rotation period of 12.48 days, and an age between 500 Myr and 1.1Gyr. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photometry of the system indicates that there are three transiting mini-Neptunes with the following properties: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planet b: Radius = 2.049 R⊕, Period  = 9.531 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planet c: Radius = 2.701 R⊕, Period  = 51.699 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planet d: Radius = 2.474 R⊕, Period  = 84.839 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An additional Earth sized planet has also been detected with a radius of 0.81 R⊕ and orbital period of 4.32 days. This planet is thought to be on the inner edge of the habitable zone which is 0.339-0.844 au. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05286"&gt;Distances for the RR Lyrae stars UU Ceti, UW Gruis, &amp;amp; W Tucanae&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Parker et. al.,  2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020 three RRab type stars were observed in the B,V,i,z bandpasses, these were UU Ceti, UW Gruis, and W Tucanae. Using the period-luminosity relationships of Catalen et al. (2004) and Caceres &amp;amp; Catelan (2008) distances were derived, with results  consistent to those presented by the Gaia Early DR3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the TESS data available for UU Cet and W Tuc Fourier decompositions were applied, and using a stepwise linear regression, an empirical relationship between the decomposition and the pulsation period with metallicity [Fe/H] was derived. This derivation allowed for the calculation of the metallicities of the two objects, which are consistent with those found in the literature. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers!  This week we are looking at three papers from the archive, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13382"&gt;TESS Eclipsing Binary Stars. I. Short cadence observations of 4584 eclipsing binaries in Sectors 1-26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Prsa et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors present a catalog of 4584 eclipsing binaries observed by TESS during its first two Cycles. The paper reviews the selection criteria for the objects presented in the catalog, in addition to discussing newly discovered eclipsing systems, and system parameters such as the ephemerides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of the paper also propose the use of a binary star morphology classification based on a dimensionality reduction algorithm, rather than the more broadly used discrete classes. The sample is also analyzed as a whole, providing completeness estimates and discussion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The catalog is available on MAST &lt;a href="http://tessebs.villanova.edu"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13155"&gt;No Such Thing as a Simple Flare: Substructure and QPPs Observed in a Statistical Sample of 20 Second Cadence TESS Flares&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Ward et. al.,  2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Cycle 3, TESS was used to observe 266 low-mass flare stars with a 20-second cadence, detecting 3792 stellar flares with an energy of &amp;gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; erg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By studying 440 of the brighter flares (97% of which have a release energy &amp;gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; erg) the authors revealed that there is a degeneracy present in the 2-minute cadence data between sharply-peaked and weakly-peaked flares, this degeneracy however is broken in the 20-second cadence data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high-cadenced TESS data allowed for an improved resolution of the the rise phase of the flares and as such it was determined that 46% of large flares exhibit substructure during this phase. 
In the sample there are 49 candidate quasi-periodic pulsators  QPP), with 17 confirmed at a 3+ sigma level. Most of the QLPs have periods of less than 10 minutes, indicating that short period QPPs are common.
QPPs are found in both the rise and decay phases of the flares, including a rise-phase QPP in a large flare from Proxima Cen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various templates are tested against the flares with that from Davenport et al. (2014) providing a good fit to most classical flares observed at high cadence, 9% however favored a Gaussian peak.
The properties of complex flares were also charaterized in the paper, with 17% of complex flares exhibiting "peak-bump" morphologies. These are light curves that are composed of a large, highly impulsive peak followed by a second more gradual Gaussian peak. See this paper for more information about this fascinating flare sample. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13069"&gt;The young HD 73583 (TOI-560) planetary system: Two 10-M⊕ mini-Neptunes transiting a 750-Myr-old, bright, and active K dwarf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Barragán et. al.,  2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of this paper present the discovery of two transiting planets which were discovered by TESS around the young bright star HD 73583, also known as TOI-560. Through the conduction of detailed follow-up observations, both photometric and spectroscopic, the authors confirm and characterize the system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The host star, HD 73583, is a 750 Myr old star which has a rotation period of 12.2 days, a mass of 0.71 M⊙, and a radius of 0.66 R⊙. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first planet,  HD 73583 b, has an orbital period of 6.4 days, a mass of 10 M⊕, a radius of  2.81 R⊕, and so a density of 2.43 g cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;. The atmospheric mass-loss rates of this planet is estimated as 2.4×10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; gs&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second planet, HD 73583 c, has an orbital period of 18.9 days, a mass of 9.6 M⊕, a radius of  2.37 R⊕, and so a density of 3.97 g cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;. The atmospheric mass-loss rates of this planet is estimated as 5.4×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; gs&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The planets are thought to have a solid core with a thick surrounding envelope. Due to the young age of the host star the system is prime candidate for follow up transmission spectroscopy and the search for mass-loss signatures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fig. 1:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Taken from Prsa et. al., (2021). Map of TESS EBs observed in sectors 1–26 in the Galactic reference frame. Depicted in green are all vetted and validated EBs observed with the 2-min cadence. Depicted in cyan are the simulated EBs brighter than T = 12 (Wells &amp;amp; Prˇsa 2021). The dearth of systems in the region north of the ecliptic plane is due to the change in boresight in sectors 14-16 and 24-26, where the satellite was pointed at +85o instead of the nominal +54o to mitigate excessive contamination by stray Earthlight and Moonlight in cameras 1 and 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fig. 2:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Taken from Ward et. al., (2021).  Even the morphologies of very large M-dwarf flares can be degenerate at 2 min cadence. While both flares appear similar when binned to 2 min cadence (green), 20 second cadence observations reveal the left flare actually emits at a near-constant level during peak while the right flare emits according to a classical impulsive profile. Since the high cadence behavior of flares is usually assumed to follow a classical emission profile in photo-chemical models of planetary atmospheres and other contexts (e.g. Howard et al. 2018; Tilley et al. 2019), alternate morphologies may change the rates of chemical reactions as compared to those modeled under classical flares.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers!  This week we are looking at three papers from the archive, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06885"&gt;TKS V. Twin sub-Neptunes Transiting the Nearby G Star HD 63935&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Scarsdale et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two almost identically size sub-Neptune transiting planets were discovered using data from TESS, Keck HIRES, and Lick APF. The planets orbit the bright 8.6 V-band magnitude star HD 63935, which is Sun like in nature and has an effective temperature of 5560 K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first planet was identified by TESS in Sectors 7 and 34. Known as HD 63935 b (TOI-509.01), the planet has a period of 9.06 days, a radius of 2.99 R⊕, and a mass of 10.8 M⊕.
The second planet was identified during the authors follow up campaign of the system using Keck HIRES and Lick APF radial velocity data. HD 63935 c has a period of 21.4 days, a radius of 2.9 R⊕, and a mass of 11.1 M⊕. This planet was also confirmed using TESS Sector 34 photometry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05628"&gt;The TESS-Keck Survey. VI. Two Eccentric sub-Neptunes Orbiting HIP-97166&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Mason et. al.,  2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While conducting a search of TESS Objects of Interest for planets with eccentric orbits, the authors of this paper discovered HIP-97166b (TOI-1255b), a sub-Neptune planet transiting its host star. The orbit of the planet is 10.3 days, with the host being a K0 dwarf located 68 pc from Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HIP-97166b was confirmed using ground-based radial velocity measurements from which as mass of 20 M⨁ and radius of 2.7 R⨁ were derived. An additional non-transiting exoplanet, HIP-97166c, was also discovered with an orbit of 16.8 days and a mass of 10 M⨁. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the short transit duration of the inner planet might suggest a high eccentricity, a joint RV-photometry analysis revealed a high impact parameter b=0.84±0.03 and a moderate eccentricity. By modeling the dynamics of the system with the condition that it must remain stable over &amp;gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; orbits, eccentricity constraints of 0.16 and &amp;lt;0.25 for planets b and c respectively.  See this fascinating paper for more information about the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04220"&gt;TOI-530b: A giant planet transiting an M dwarf detected by TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Gan et. al.,  2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TESS data was used to discover a giant planet transiting an M0.5V dwarf star know as TOI-530 which is located 147.7 pc away with a radius of 0.54 R⊙ and a mass of 0.53 M⊙.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The planet, TOI-530b, was verified using ground-based multi-wavelength photometry, high resolution spectroscopy from SPIRou, and high-angular-resolution imaging. The radius of the planet is 0.83 R&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, with a mass of 0.4 M&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, and an orbit of 6.39 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The host star has a V-band magnitude of 15.4, which means that TOI-530b orbits one of the faintest stars accessible by ground-based spectroscopy. TOI-530b is also one of only six known transiting giant planets hosted by an M-type star, which is predicted to be a rare occurrence according to core accretion theory. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers!  This week we are looking at three papers from the archive, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01019"&gt;Mysterious Dust-emitting Object Orbiting TIC 400799224&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Powell et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors present the discovery of what could be a disintegrating asteroid or minor planet orbiting a star in the wide binary TIC 400799224. The system was identified in TESS Sector 10 data which presented unusual dips in the light curve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speckle imaging of the system went on to indicate that it actually consists of two stars of comparative brightness with a separation of 0.62". The two stars are likely bound and have a projected separation of ~300 au. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archival ASAS-SN and Evryscope data also identified a strong periodicity of the dips at ~19.77 days, indicating that an occulting object is orbiting the host star. These dips appear to occur sporadically and are detectable only every three to five transits, suggesting a sporadically-emitting dust cloud. The cloud is quite optically thick, had a mass of ~10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; grams, and seems to block 37-75% of the light from the host star. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00489"&gt;TIC~257060897b: an inflated, low-density, hot-Jupiter transiting a rapidly evolving subgiant star&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Montalto et. al.,  2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A transiting exoplanet has been discovered around TIC~257060897 using TESS full frame images. Using spectra from HARPS-N and photometry from other ground-based facilities, the authors confirm that the transit is indeed caused by a planet. The host star is ~3.5 Gyr old subgiant with an an effective temperature of 6128 K, a log ~g of 4.2, a [Fe/H] value of 0.2, a mass of 1.32 M⊙ and a radius of 1.82 R⊙. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transiting planet TIC~257060897b, is a giant planet with a mass of 0.67 M&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, a radius of 1.49 R&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, has an orbital period of ~3.66 days, and very low density of 0.25 g cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;. Given this density the author argue that the inflation of the planets radius may be related to the fast increase of the host luminosity as it evolves beyond the main sequence. The planet could therefore be a precursor of the inflated radius short period planets, which are found around low luminosity red giant branch stars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14514"&gt;ASAS J071404+7004.3 -- a close, bright nova-like with gusty winds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Inight et. al.,  2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASAS J071404+7004.3 is a bright nova-like cataclysmic with a V-band magnitude of 11.8 and at a distance of 212 pc. This paper presents optical spectroscopy of the object from the Isaac Newton Telescope in addition to UV data from  Swift X-ray and photometry from TESS. Using these data the authors find a period of 3.27 hrs and a mass transfer rate of 4 - 9 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-9&lt;/sup&gt;  M⊙ yr&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historical photometry indicates at least one low state period, establishing the system as a VY Scl star. VY Scl stars show no outbursts, but are are nova like objects that occasionally experience a greater than one magnitude fall in brightness, bringing them into the dwarf nova instability strip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High cadence spectroscopy also reveals the presence of rapidly changing winds emanating from the accretion disc. These winds were then modeled, the results of which indicated that all emission lines could emanate from the wind, which would explain the lack of double peaked lines in these systems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers!  This week we are looking at three papers from the archive, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07329"&gt;First results on RR Lyrae stars with the TESS space telescope: untangling the connections between mode content, colors and distances&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Molnár et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An RR Lyrae are horizontal branch stars  that pulsate radially with large amplitudes and short periods. These variations allow them to be used as distance indicators, making them what is know as "standard candles" in cosmology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The large area, continuous coverage, high cadence, and precision of TESS make a perfect instrument to monitor RR Lyrae stars. In this paper the authors have examined a sample of 118 RR Lyrae observed in TESS Sectors 1 and 2. Combining the parameters derived from the TESS light curves with parallax and color information from Gaia, a comprehensive classification scheme has been created. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors find that a large fraction of the RR Lyare have various low-amplitude modes, but that the distribution of those modes is very different from those of the bulge stars. It would therefore seem that the differences in the physical parameters have an observable effect on the excitation of extra modes, which may help in determining the origin of the signals. Unfortunately, mode identification is hindered by uncertainties when trying to find the true pulsation frequencies of the extra modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors go on to compare mode amplitude ratios in classical double-mode stars, to stars with extra modes at low amplitudes. This investigation points to the existence of two distinct groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the fundamental mode pulsators, they find a high percent of modulated stars, and at least 28% of them do not exhibit modulation i.e., that they do not exhibit the Blazhko effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06311"&gt;The winking eye of a hefty star. WR 21a revealed as a very massive eclipsing binary by TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Barba et al.,  2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The constellation of Carina is host to one of the most massive binary systems in the Galaxy, with one of the most massive stars. It is composed of an O2.5 If &amp;#42;/WN6ha primary and an O3 V((f&amp;#42;))z secondary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using data from TESS the authors have examined the time series variations, which appear to be formed by two main components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A sharp partial eclipse of the secondary by the primary star. As this is a detached system the eclipse corresponds to the periastron passage. The shape of the eclipse observed also indicates the presence of a heartbeat effect. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tidally excited oscillations. The frequencies derived for the tidally excited oscillations are harmonics of the orbital period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilizing new and archival radial velocity measurements a new spectroscopic orbital solution was derived, and from the TESS data a new ephemeris value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TESS light curve was then modeled using PHOEBE, and a stellar radius of  23.3 R⊙ calculated for the primary and 14.8 R⊙ for the secondary. The orbital inclination was determined as  61.8 degrees, leading to a mass of 94.4 M⊙ for the primary and  53.6 M⊙ for the secondary being obtained. This firmly establishes WR 21a as belonging to the rare group of the very massive stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07586"&gt;Discovery of a Highly Eccentric, Chromospherically Active Binary: ASASSN-V J192114.84+624950.8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Way et. al.,  2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN) automatically surveys the entire visible night sky every day, reaching roughly 18th magnitude and thus observing many kinds of transients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper focuses on ASASSN-V J192114.84+624950.8, a transient that rapidly decreases in brightness by ~55% or ~0.9 mag in the g-band. Studying the TESS light curve of this object the authors discovered that the source is a highly eccentric, eclipsing binary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On fitting the TESS light curve the authors determined that the binary orbit has an eccentricity of 0.79, a period of 18.462 days, and an inclination of 88.6 degrees. The ratios of stellar radii and temperature were also derived as R&lt;sub&gt;2/1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.71 and T&lt;sub&gt; eff 2/1 &lt;/sub&gt; = 0.82. Spectra were obtained from LBT/MODS, which suggest that the primary is a late-G or early-K type dwarf. From SED  fitting the luminosities and temperatures of the two stars were derived as L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.48~L&lt;sub&gt;sun&lt;/sub&gt;, T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; =5050 K, L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  = 0.12 L&lt;sub&gt;sun&lt;/sub&gt; , and T2=4190 K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both stars have been determined as chromospherically active, which means that the rotational periods could be obtained as P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.52 days, P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.79 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers!  This week we are looking at three papers from the archive, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03924"&gt;Flares, Rotation, and Planets of the AU Mic System from TESS Observations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Gilbert et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking data from both Sectors 1 and  27 of the TESS mission, the authors present a combined analysis of the AU Mic system.
AU Mic is a cool red dwarf M-star which is approximately 24 million years old, and 31.9 light years away. The system contains a planet called AU Mic b, which is in a close orbit with the host. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, TESS observed AU Mic producing numerous flares and a &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2020/nasa-s-tess-spitzer-missions-discover-a-world-orbiting-a-unique-young-star"&gt;NASA feature&lt;/a&gt; was written about the object. Now, combing the data from multiple sectors, the authors compare the flare rates and analyze the spot evolution, finding that the level of activity has increased slightly between sectors. The 20-second cadenced data from Sector 27 also allows for the detection of more flares, smaller flares, and better resolved flare morphology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parameters for AU Mic b were also refined by fitting the three additional transits detected in Sector 27 via a model that includes stellar activity. Clear transit timing variations were found in the data with an amplitude of ~80 seconds. Three transits of another planet, AU Mic c, were also detected indicating a radius of 2.8 R⊕ and a period of 18.86 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03771"&gt;TOI-3362b: A Proto-Hot Jupiter Undergoing High-Eccentricity Tidal Migration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Dong et al.,  2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way in which a giant planet can be placed in short-period orbit is through a process called high-eccentricity tidal migration. If this process were to occur frequently there should be several examples of proto-hot Jupiters in highly elliptical orbits going through it, however only a few such systems have been discovered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors present data for TOI-3362b, a 5 M&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt; planet with a period of 18.1 days, orbiting a main-sequence F-type star. This planet is likely undergoing high-eccentricity tidal migration, with an orbital eccentricity of 0.815. Given that the planet has a semi-major axis of 0.153 au, the orbital period is expected to shrink to a final orbital radius of 0.051 au once tidal circularization is complete. The extreme eccentricity of the planet could be explained by interactions with other planets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that the planets period is close to the period sensitivity of TESS, even a few discoveries like this one could indicate that proto-hot Jupiters may be quite common. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.11403"&gt;TOI-1518b: A Misaligned Ultra-hot Jupiter with Iron in its Atmosphere&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Cabot et. al.,  2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors present the discovery of TOI-1518b, an ultra-hot Jupiter with a bright (V=8.95), fast-rotating, F0 host star (T&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; ~ 7300 K). EXPRES optical transmission spectra were used to confirm the transiting planet, which is inflated with an R&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.875 R&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The planet has a misaligned orbit of 240.34 degrees, a nearly grazing transit with b = 0.9036, and has a 1.9 day orbit around its host during which it experiences intense irradiation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TESS data clearly show a secondary eclipse with a depth of 364 ppm, and there is a significant phase curve signal from which a relative day-night planetary flux difference of ~320 ppm is derived, and a 5.2 sigma detection of ellipsoidal distortion on the host. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through an atmospheric cross-correlation analysis the authors detect neutral Iron at K&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = 157 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;sys&lt;/sub&gt; = -16 km s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, which means that the planet is a highly irradiated gas-giant planet with Fe detections in transmission. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers!  This week we are looking at three papers from the archive, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02912"&gt;OO Dra: an Algol-type binary formed through an extremely helium-poor mass accretion revealed by asteroseismology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Chen et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OO Dra is an eclipsing binary with an orbital period of 1.23838 days. Eclipsing binaries are important objects as they help us to understand stellar structure and evolution. 
Using TESS 2-minute cadenced data, the authors have analyzed the intrinsic oscillations of the primary component and identified seven confident and independent delta Scuti frequencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-star evolutionary models and mass-accreting models are computed to reproduce delta Scuti frequencies, with the fitting of residuals matching well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through asteroseismology the  authors determine the stellar parameters of the primary as M = 1.92 M⊙, Z = 0.011, R = 2.068 R⊙, log g = 4.090, T = 8346 K, and L = 18.65 L⊙. These parameters match well with the dynamical parameters of the binary model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The asteroseismology results also indicate that OO Dra is an Algol system which has undergone the rapid mass-transfer stage. The pulsator is likely a helium poor star with an age of 8.22 Myr, and that the primary is probably an un-evolved star formed by an extremely helium-poor mass accretion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02310"&gt;TOI-431/HIP 26013: a super-Earth and a sub-Neptune transiting a bright, early K dwarf, with a third RV planet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Osborn et al.,  2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors present the discovery of TOI-431, a bright, multi-planet system which has a stellar rotation period is 30.5 days. The system has been studied by the authors using radial velocity measurements and photometry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orbiting the host there are three planets,  a super-Earth known as TOI-431b, a sub-Neptune known as TOI-431d, and TOI-431c which was not seen to transit the host. 
TOI-431b has a period of 0.49 days, a radius of 1.28 R⊕, a mass of 3.07 M⊕, and a density of 8.0 g cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;. 
TOI-431d has a period of 12.46 days, a radius of 3.29 R⊕, a mass of 9.90 M⊕, and a density of 1.36 g cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;. This planet is also likely to have an extended atmosphere.
TOI-431c has an M sin i  of 2.83 M⊕, and a period of 4.85 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All planets straddle the radius gap and present an interesting case-study for atmospheric evolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02294"&gt;TESS Giants Transiting Giants I: A Non-inflated Hot Jupiter Orbiting a Massive Subgiant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Saunders et. al.,  2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of confirmed transiting exoplanets around evolved stars is still relatively low. This paper presents the discovery and characterization of a hot Jupiter orbiting a massive evolved sub-giant star, designated TOI-2184. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The host star has a mass of 1.53M⊙, a radius of  2.90 R⊙, and is located in the TESS southern continuous viewing zone. Due to periodic systematics which introduced spurious transit depth differences, this planet was originally flagged as a false positive by the TESS Quick-look Pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a new pipeline, which removes the scattered light from the TESS full frame images (FFIs), the authors combined the TESS photometry with that from the ground, in addition to radial velocity measurements. From this work a planet radius of 1.017 R&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt; and mass of 0.65 M&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt; were derived. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mass and radius obtained are very close to that of Jupiter, and given the planets close proximity to its host star, this is unusual. The planet is in fact smaller than what is theoretically predicted based on the incident flux. See this paper for more information. &lt;/p&gt;

Top plot: detrending the TESS light curves and fitting models for TOI-431 b and c. Top: the full, 2-min cadence PDCSAP light curve, with no detrending for stellar activity, is shown in grey. Each sector has 2 segments of continuous viewing, and the gaps in the data correspond to the spacecraft down-linking the data to Earth after a TESS orbit of 13.7 days. Overlaid in green is the GP model that has been fit to this data (described in Section 3.2.1 of the paper), in order to detrend the stellar activity . Middle: the flux detrended with the GP model, with the transit models for TOI-431 b (orange) and d (blue) overlaid. The expected transit times for the 2 further transits of TOI-431 d, both of which fall in the data down-link, are marked with blue arrows. Bottom: residuals when the best fit model and GP have been subtracted from the PDCSAP flux. The baseline flux (normalized to 0) is shown in dark grey. Bottom plot: phase folds of the TESS data for TOI-431 b (left), c (middle, with no transit evident), and d (right), with the flux binned as red circles, and the residuals of the folds once the best fit models have been subtracted from the flux shown in the bottom panels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The alternating triangle colors represent the even and odd transits. The gray sections mark the data gaps due to data downlinks or the spacecraft entering safe mode. While the even transits (blue) fall almost exclusively in the middle of continuous data collection, the odd transits (orange) fall primarily near the beginning or end of a data gap when the TESS detector is experiencing increased scatter due to thermal sensitivity variation and scattered light. This trend is most present in the first seven observing sectors (top two rows), and disappears for the final four sectors (bottom row).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="news"></category></entry><entry><title>TESS Weekly Bulletin: August 10th</title><link href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/tess-weekly-bulletin-august-10th.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-08-10T10:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2021-08-10T10:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Rebekah Hounsell</name></author><id>tag:heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov,2021-08-10:/docs/tess/tess-weekly-bulletin-august-10th.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;STATUS UPDATE: Check out our new&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/gallery.html"&gt;outreach products&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers!  This week we are looking at three papers from the archive, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14737"&gt;A Second Planet Transiting LTT~1445A and a Determination of the Masses of Both Worlds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Winters et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers!  This week we are looking at three papers from the archive, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14737"&gt;A Second Planet Transiting LTT~1445A and a Determination of the Masses of Both Worlds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Winters et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors present the discovery of a new world orbiting LTT 1445A, the primary star in a hierarchical triple M-dwarf star system located at a distance of 6.86 parsecs. The star is roughly a quarter the mass of our Sun, and is known to host LTT 1445Ab, a transiting planet with an orbital period of 5.4 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second planet, LTT 1445Ac,  was discovered by the authors using TESS data, and was found to have an orbital period of 3.1 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilizing radial velocity measurements taken from additional facilities, the mass and radius of the two planet were determined.  LTT 1445Ab  has a mass of 2.87 M&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;  and a radius of 1.304 R&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;, consistent with an Earth-like composition of 33% iron and 67% magnesium silicate. LTT 1445Ac has a mass of 1.54 M&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;    and a minimum radius of 1.15 R&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The orbits of the two planets are consistent with being circular, but they are mutually inclined by at least 2.25 degrees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photometry and spectroscopy of the three stars in the system indicate that LTT 1445C (0.161 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;) is likely the source of the 1.4 day rotation period, whilst LTT 1445B (0.215 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;) has a rotation period of 6.7 days. The planet host star, LTT 1445A, has a likely rotation period of 85 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All data collected on this triple M-dwarf system, indicate that it is in a special evolutionary stage where the most massive M dwarf has spun down, the intermediate mass M dwarf is in the process of spinning down, while the least massive stellar component has not yet begun to spin down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14125"&gt;A large sub-Neptune transiting the thick-disk M4V TOI-2406&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Wells et al.,  2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors report on the discovery and validation of a sub-Neptune planet orbiting TOI-2406, a mid-M dwarf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The host star properties were inferred using its near-infrared spectrum, spectral energy distribution, and Gaia parallax measurement. The host was found to be a metal-poor M4V star, at a distance of 56 pc, with a sub-solar metallically of [Fe/H] = -0.38, and is a member of the thick disc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multi-band photometry were used to confirm that the transit event is on-target and achromatic, and the authors statistically validated the TESS signal as a transiting exoplanet. Planet properties were determined via a global transit model of the TESS and ground-based time-series data. The planet is a relatively large sub-Neptune for the M-dwarf population, has a radius of 2.94 R⊕, a period of 3.077 days, and a transit depth of 2%. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large sub-Neptune planets don't tend to occur around the cooler stars in the Galaxy, and it is even more unlikely when those stars are metal-poor.  This system is therefore very interesting and presents  a benchmark for large-planet formation around metal-poor, low-mass stars. Please see the paper for more information about this fascinating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13670"&gt;TOI-532b: The Habitable-zone Planet Finder confirms a Large Super Neptune in the Neptune Desert orbiting a metal-rich M dwarf host&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Kanodia et. al.,  2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TOI-532b has been confirmed as a planet using a combination of  precise near-infrared radial velocities with the Habitable-zone Planet Finder, TESS light curves, ground-based photometric follow-up, and high-contrast imaging. Examination of these data has led to the determination that TOI-532 is a faint, metal-rich M dwarf, with an effective temperature of 3957 K, and a metallicity of  [Fe/H] = 0.38. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The star is host to a transiting gaseous planet with a period of 2.3 days, radius of 5.82 R⊕, and a mass of 61.5 M⊕. This planet is the most massive  super Neptune detected around an M dwarf with both mass and radius measurements, and it bridges the gap between the Neptune-sized planets and the heavier Jovian planets known to orbit M dwarfs.  See this paper for more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

The 2-minute data points (grey) have been binned by 15 to produce the black points, with error bars corresponding to the standard deviation in the bins, which match the FFI light curve cadence of 30 min. Regions marked in red were excluded from the analysis: In Sector 3, there were poor-quality engineering data between orbits; and in Sector 30, a significant trend at the end was possibly caused by scattered light. Regions marked in grey correspond to data taken outside of science data acquisition for testing purposes but used in the analysis. One transit occurred in this period, towards the end of Sector 3. The transits of TOI-2406 b are labelled with green markers below the light curves.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers to this weeks news bulletin. This week we are looking at three papers from the archive, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers to this weeks news bulletin. This week we are looking at three papers from the archive, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06293"&gt;EvryFlare IV: Detection of periodicity in flare occurrence from cool stars with TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Howard et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The periodic occurrence of stellar flares may used as a probe into electromagnetic star-planet interaction (SPI), binary interaction, or magnetic conditions in spots. In this paper the authors utilize high-cadenced two minute TESS data in order to study a sample of 284 cool stars and their flare periodograms. Using these data the authors seek to identify periodicity due to magnetic interactions with orbiting companions, magnetic reservoirs, or due to rotational phase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking this large sample of stars, periods from 1-10 days are searched for using newly developed periodograms. These periodograms are a new Bayesian likelihood periodogram and a modified Lomb-Scargle periodogram, and been constructed by the authors to better account for phased flaring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper finds six candidates with a false alarm probability below 1%, three targets are grater than 3-sigma detections of flare periodicity; the others are plausible candidates which cannot be individually confirmed. See the paper for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06254"&gt;Directly Determined Properties of HD 97658 from Interferometric Observations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Ellis et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HD 97658 is host to a super-Earth known as HD 97658 b, utilizing interferometric observations taken by the CHARA Array, the authors measure the hosts limb-darkened angular diameter to be θLD = 0.314 mas. Combining this measurement with the Gaia EDR3 parallax value (with the zero-point correction) yields a stellar radius of 0.728 R⊙.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bolometric flux of the star is measured as 2.42 ± 0.05 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-8&lt;/sup&gt; erg s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;, and the effective temperature derived as 5212 K, these values agree with previous estimates based on spectroscopy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors go on to use their derived measurements in combination with stellar evolution models and transit properties to determine the age of the system and constrain the properties of the planet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TESS observed the system during Sector 22 for approximately 23 days, with a two minute cadence.  Using the PDCSAP_Flux the authors evaluated the time-series for signs of rotation  due to star-spots passing in and out of the field of view. They found that the average brightness of HD 97658 is stable with a RMS of 385 ppm, and so no evidence of long-term variability due to spots during the observation period. This conclusion is consistent with TESS observation period being shorter than the derived rotation period of 34 days (Guo et al. 2020).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TESS data were also used to search for transits via a Box Least-Squares periodogram. This allowed for the detection of the super-Earth HD97658 b, with an approximate period of 9.474 d. These data were combined with that from EXOFASTv2 to derive several additional planet parameters such as the radius 2.12 R⊕, effective temperature 750 K, and mass 7.5 M⊕.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TESS and  EXOFASTv2  data also revealed a potential additional planet. Please see the paper for more information about this system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05430"&gt;TOI-1749: an M dwarf with a Trio of Planets including a Near-Resonant Pair&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Fukui et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors report on the discovery of a super-Earth, TOI-1749b, and two sub-Neptunes TOI-1749c and TOI-1749d, all transiting an early M dwarf star at a distance of 100 pc. All planets were discovered using TESS data, and confirmed using ground-based measurements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors find that TOI-1749b, c, and d have orbital periods of 2.39, 4.49, and 9.05 days, and radii of 1.4, 2.1, and 2.5 R⊕, respectively. They also place 95\% confidence upper limits on the masses of the planets with estimates of 57, 14, and 15 M⊕ for TOI-1749b, c, and d, respectively, derived via transit timing variations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the parameters derived, the authors hypothesize that all three planets initially had a hydrogen envelope on top of a rocky core, and only the envelope of the innermost planet has been stripped away by photo-evaporation and/or core-powered mass loss mechanisms. Please see this paper for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

Periodicity from these flare stars was detected with the authors newly-developed flare periodograms. Flares large enough to comprise the phased-flares signal (i.e. with amplitudes above the threshold amplitude Athresh) are highlighted in red. Smaller flares are highlighted in light orange. Predicted times when high-amplitude flares will occur are shaded in grey. Out-of-flare variability in the light curve is de-trended with a Savitsky-Golay filter. Some phased-flare targets are stronger detections than others, with A and B as the clearest.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers to this weeks news bulletin. This week we are looking at three papers from the archive, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15104"&gt;TACOS: TESS AM~CVn Outbursts Survey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Marcano et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AM Canum Venaticorum  (AM CVn) stars are a type of cataclysmic variable (CV) in which a white dwarf accretes hydrogen poor material from a compact companion star. In this paper the authors conduct a systematic study of their outbursts, using 9 TESS AV CVn light curves, to place limits on the models. These 9 objects show both super-outbursts and normal outbursts, but the continuous coverage and high cadence of TESS has allowed the authors to place strict limits on the duration and structure of these outbursts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors have found that in some of the systems enhanced mass transfer is needed to explain the observed light curve of the super-outburst and the re-brightening phase. In other systems the color evolution from simultaneous observations in g and r-bands from ZTF, differ from the previously reported color evolution of the longer period AM CVns, where the enhanced mass transfer is responsible for the super-outburst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the previous lack of high cadenced data the authors find that the duration of many AM CVn stars may have been overestimated. New durations have now been calculated for six of the systems investigated. Precursors have also been found to be a common feature of super-outbursts in AM CVns, and five of the six super-outburst have these. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high cadenced 2 and 10 minute TESS data has allowed for the derivation of two new orbital periods, both of which are in good agreement with predictions based on past outbursts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15063"&gt;The unpopular Package: a Data-driven Approach to De-trend TESS Full Frame Image Light Curves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Hattori et al.,  2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TESS mission provides most of its data in the form of full frame images or FFIs. These FFIs contain various systematic effects such as pointing jitter and scattered light from the Earth and Moon. These systematics must be removed from the data before it is used in scientific analysis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors present an open source Python package called "unpopular", which can remove the systematic trends via the casual pixel model method. The code assumes that the shared flux variations across multiple distant pixels are likely to be systematics. The code then removes the trends by modeling the systematics in a given pixel's light curve as a linear combination of light curves from many other distant pixels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overfitting is always an issue in such an analysis, but is prevented here by employing a ridge regression train-and-test framework, where the data points being de-trended are separated from those used to obtain the model coefficients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simultaneous fitting with a polynomial model to capture any long term astrophysical trends is also allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out more about this code and its application to various astrophysical phenomena, please read the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00220"&gt;Detection of photometric variability in the very low-mass binary VHS J1256-1257AB using TESS and Spitzer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Miles-Páez,  2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper looks at VHS J1256-1257AB is an equal mass M7.5 binary system with a late L-dwarf companion - VHS J1256-1257 b, forming one of the few young triple systems of ultra-cool dwarfs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-minute TESS data is used with that from Spitzer to examine the optical and infrared light curves of the system. This examination reveals periodical epochs of quasi-sinusoidal modulation, followed by stochastic variability which resembles the beat pattern created by two waves of similar frequencies that interfere with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying a two wave model to the TESS data, the authors show that the components of VHS J1256-1257AB rotate with periods of 2.0782 hr and 2.1342 hr, values that are supported by the Spitzer observations. The fluxes of VHS J1256-1257A and B  are equal and alternate between states of phase and anti-phase - this explains the observed photometric variability in their combined light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See this paper for more information about this fascinating system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers this weeks news bulletin in which we look at three papers from the archive, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08660"&gt;Discovery of an inflated hot Jupiter around a slightly evolved star TOI-1789&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Khandelwal et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors report on the discovery of a hot Jupiter with an orbital period of  3.2 days, as derived from TESS and ground-based photometry, with radial velocity measurements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The host is TOI-1789, a late F-type metal rich ([Fe/H] =  0.37 dex) star, which has a TESS magnitude of 9.1. The radius of the star is 2.172 R⊙, and it is located 223.56 pc away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By simultaneously fitting the light curves and the radial velocity data of TOI-1789, the authors determined the TOI-1789b planetary mass as 0.70 M&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, with a radius of 1.40 R&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, a bulk density of 0.31 g cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, and an orbital separation of  0.04873 AU. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TOI-1789b is therefore an inflated hot Jupiter, and one of the few nearby evolved stars with a close-in planet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13242"&gt;Searching For Transiting Planets Around Halo Stars. II. Constraining the Occurrence Rate of Hot Jupiters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Boley et al.,  2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is thought that giant or Jovian planets preferentially form around stars with solar or super solar metallicities, and that it is more challenging for them to form within metal poor environments. Hot Jupiters are thought to form via metallicity dependent core accretion, and as such it is even more difficult for them to form in poor metallically environments. 
A more thorough investigation of hot-Jupiters around metal poor stars however, is required to obtain constraints, but this is difficult due to the sample size, and limited quality data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilizing high-cadenced data from TESS, the authors have examined a large sample of halo stars in order to constrain the upper limit of hot Jupiters within the metal poor regime i.e., -2.0 ≤ [Fe/H] ≤ -0.6, allowing the most stringent upper limit to be calculated. The authors find the mean 1-σ upper limit to be 0.18 % for planets with radii 0.8 - 2.0 R&lt;sub&gt;Jupiter&lt;/sub&gt;, and periods of 0.5−10 days. This result is consistent with previous predictions indicating that there exists a certain metallicity below which no planets can form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SRG 062340.2-265715 is an unusual cataclysmic variable (CV) that was observed by TESS in 2020. In this paper the authors conduct a further investigation into the object using ground- and space-based follow up spectroscopy and photometry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optical spectroscopy of the G =12.5 mag counterpart reveals the system to be a nova-like CV at a distance of 495pc. 
Previous observations of the system with TESS indicated an orbital period of 3.941 hrs, this however was not detected in more recent observations. The more recent, higher cadenced TESS data did however, reveal a quasi-periodic oscillation at around 25 min, with ground-based photometry indicating a variability of 32 min. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This object is located in very sparsely populated regions of color-magnitude diagrams for both X-ray and optical colors and magnitudes. It could be an X-ray under-luminous magnetic CV, an intermediate polar, or an over-luminous nonmagnetic CV. The lack of a clear period or spin, prevents final classification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers this weeks news bulletin in which we look at three papers from the archive, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06329"&gt;New eclipsing binaries with mercury-manganese stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Kochukhov et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eclipsing binary systems are rare and useful in that they allow for the precise determination of fundamental stellar parameters. Early-type chemically peculiar stars within these eclipsing binaries are even more important as they enable a better understanding of the origin and evolution of their unusual chemistry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper uses TESS data to examine six eclipsing Mercury-manganese (HgMn) stars.  These are late B-main sequence stars which have an abundance of heavy elements, slow rotation, and low magnetic fields. The authors discuss observations of eclipse variability in these systems, the discovery of which double the known number of eclipsing HgMn stars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The characteristics of each of the six binaries were examined, and the authors confirmed the eclipses in HD 72208 - establishing this object as the longest-period eclipsing HgMn star. Two of the systems, HD 36892 and HD 53004, are eccentric systems showing heartbeat variability in addition to eclipses. HD 53004 has the highest eccentricity amongst all 
 eclipsing HgMn stars known to date, and also has tidally induced oscillations. HD 55776 may also be orbited by a white dwarf. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using TESS data the authors report on the discovery and validation of a double planetary system around a bright,  V-band magnitude 8.85, G dwarf star known as TOI 2319. This host star has a radius of 1.43 R⊙, 1.15 M⊙. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transits for the planets were originally detected by citizen scientists using TESS sector 25 data as part of the Planet Hunters project. When modeling these transits the authors determine a radius of 3.41 R⊕ for the inner planet, and an orbital period of 19.26 - 35 days and a radius of 5.83 R⊕ for the outer planet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radial velocities from HARPS-N and EXPRES allowed a mass estimate for the two planets, with planet b (the inner planet) estimated at 11.56 M⊕, and planet c having an upper mass limit of 27.5  M⊕. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors present the results of a brown dwarf orbiting a M0V star known as TOI-1278. The brown dwarf has a mass of  18.5 M&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;, and was first identified via a percent deep transit in the TESS photometry, which upon further inspection was reveled to be a grazing transit of a Jupiter sized object. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radial velocity data taken by the  SPIRou near-infrared high-resolution velocimeter and spectropolarimeter led to the detection of a Keplerian RV signal with a semi-amplitude of 2306 m/s in phase, with a 14.5-day transit period, and a slight eccentricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers this weeks news bulletin in which we look at three papers from the archive, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01246"&gt;TOI-674b: an oasis in the desert of exo-Neptunes transiting a nearby M dwarf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Murgas et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors examine data from TESS, Spitzer, HARPS, and ground-based facilities, to establish the physical properties of TOI-674b - a planet transiting a 14.2 V-band magnitude M-dwarf star known as TIC 158588995.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors determine that  TOI-674b is a low-density super-Neptune, and that the host star has a M2V spectral type with a mass of 0.42 M⊙, radius of 0.42 R⊙, and  effective temperature of 3514 K. The system itself is approximately 46 pc away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilizing light curve and radial velocity measurements, a circular orbit model was fit through which an orbital period of 1.98 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt; days was calculated, in addition to a planetary radius of 5.25 R⊕, and a mass of 23.6 M⊕. The density of the planet is therefore estimated as 0.91 g cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;.  A non circular orbit fit produced similar results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mass and radius of the planet indicates that it is one of the largest and most massive super-Neptunes around an M-type star known to date.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02610"&gt;Visible-light Phase Curves from the Second Year of the TESS Primary Mission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Wong et al.,  2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using TESS year 2 data, the authors of this paper carried out a systematic study of full-orbit phase curves for known transiting systems in the northern hemisphere. Fifteen transit systems were selected and seven had statistically significant secondary eclipses and day-night atmospheric brightness modulations, these were: HAT-P-7, KELT-1, KELT-9, KELT-16, KELT-20, Kepler-13A, and WASP-12. Two of the seven,  KELT-9b and WASP-12b, have small eastward dayside hotspot offsets. An additional three, KELT-1, Kepler-13A, and WASP-12, have phase-curve variability which can be attributed to the tidal distortion of the host star. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spitzer data were combined with that from TESS to compute the dayside brightness temperatures of the planets, the TESS geometric albedos, Bond albedos, and the phase integrals. Using the new albedo values the trend between the dayside temperature and the geometric albedo for planets with 1500&amp;lt;T&lt;sub&gt;day&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;lt;3000 K, was confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more detailed study was conducted for Kepler-13Ab - please see the paper for more details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03568"&gt;Unveiling the multiple periodicities of the cataclysmic variable LS Cam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Stefanov et al.,  2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LS Cam is an intermediate polar cataclysmic variable (CVs). Some CVs have quasi-periodic changes in brightness with periods slightly shorter or longer than the orbital period - these are called superhumps. Superhumps are thought to be a beat period of 
of the orbital period and the apsidal or nodal motion of the disk,  but the exact cause remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using TESS 120 second cadenced data from sectors 19, 20, and 26, the authors examined LS Cam. Focusing on Sectors 19 and 20, a periodogram analysis was performed, using the Lomb-Scargle method. The resulting power spectrum indicated four significant periodicities, the orbital period of 0.1424 days, a super-orbital variation of 4.053 days, a permanent negative superhump of 0.1375 days, and when looking at Sector 26 a positive superhump of 0.155 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking relations from the literature, the mass ratio and masses of the two components are estimated as 0.24, and 1.26, and 0.30M⊙ respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers this weeks news bulletin in which we look at three papers from the archive, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08614"&gt;TIC 172900988: A Transiting Circumbinary Planet Detected in One Sector of TESS Data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Kostov et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors report on the discovery of a transiting circumbinary planet,TIC 172900988b, detected using TESS Sector 21 data. The planet is part of a binary star system, and was first seen to transit the primary star and then five days later the secondary star. The binary system is also eclipsing with a period of 19.7 days and an eccentricity of 0.45. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilizing data from ASAS-SN, Evryscope, KELT, and SuperWASP, the authors found a prominent apsidal motion of the binary orbit, caused by the dynamical interactions between the binary and the planet. On combining these data with that from TESS the authors derived the mass and radii of the primary star as 1.2377 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt; and 1.3827 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt; respectively, with the mass of the secondary as 1.2021 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt; and its radius as 1.3141 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;. The radius of the planet was calculated as 11.07 R&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;, for the mass and orbital period a range of values were found - 822 &amp;lt; M3 &amp;lt; 981 M&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;, and 188.8, 190.4, 194.0, 199.0, 200.4, or 204.1 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08844"&gt;TKS X: Confirmation of TOI-1444b and a Comparative Analysis of the Ultra-short-period Planets with Hot Neptunes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Dai et al.,  2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using TESS data the authors discovered a super-Earth on a 0.47 day orbit around a Sun-like star, this planet was named TOI-1444b and has a radius of 1.4R⊕. Using radial velocity (RV) measurements from Keck/HIRES the planet was confirmed and its mass derived as 3.87 M⊕. A possible non-transiting planet with a mass of 11.8 M⊕, may also be present in the system and was indicated by the RV measurements. The authors may also have detected a phase curve variation and secondary eclipse of TOI-1444b via the TESS data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Including this object there are only 17 ultra-short period (&amp;lt; 2R⊕; USP) planets with well measured masses and sizes, and as such the authors present a detailed examination of the small sample and compare it to that of sub-day ultra-hot Neptune class (&amp;gt;3R⊕, &amp;gt;2000F⊕  - TOI-849 b, LTT9779 b and K2-100; ). The authors find the following: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USP's have predominantly Earth like compositions with inferred iron core mass fractions of 0.32. Ultra-hot Neptunes have H/He or other volatile envelopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USP's have masses below the threshold of runaway accretion, ultra-hot Neptune's are above. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USP's are found in multi-planet systems with a  secular interaction formation scenario. Ultra-hot Neptune's tend to be "lonely" planets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USP's occur around solar-metallicity stars. Ultra-hot Neptune's tend to have higher metallicity hosts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultra-hot Neptune's are more like hot Jupiters than USP planets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08574"&gt;NGTS-19b : A high mass transiting brown dwarf in a 17-day eccentric orbit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Acton et al.,  2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors present the discovery of a high-mass transiting brown dwarf known as NGTS-19b and discovered by the Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS). Using data from TESS (sector 11), the South African Astronomical Observatory, and  the CORALIE spectrograph, the authors derive the characteristics of the system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The host star of the NGTS-19b  system is a K-star, with a mass of 69.5 M&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt; and a radius of 1.034 R&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;, with a period of 17.84 days, and an eccentricity of 0.3767. Given the mass and radius of the brown dwarf the authors estimate the age of the system to be 0.46 Gyrs, but this is not consistent with the age determined from the host star SED, indicating that the brown dwarf might be inflated. Inflation of the brown dwarf however would be difficult and unusual given its mass and the low levels of irradiation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers this weeks news bulletin in which we look at three papers from the archive, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01945"&gt;TESS and HARPS reveal two sub-Neptunes around TOI 1062&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Otegi et al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors report on the discovery of two sub-Neptunes orbiting around a G9V type star which has a V-band magnitude of 10.25. This star is known as TOI 1062 (TIC 299799658) and was observed by TESS in Sectors 1, 13, 27, and 28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precise radial velocity measurements with HARPS reveal that TOI 1062b has a  radius of 2.265 Re, a mass of 11.8 Me, and an orbital period of 4.115050 days. TOI 1062c is not transiting, but a minimum mass of 7.4 Me was determined, in addition to the fact that it is near the 2:1 mean motion resonance with TOI 1062b, with an orbital period of 8.13  days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transiting planet, TOI 1062b, has a mean density of  5.58 g cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; and its internal structure is thought to have a small volatile envelope accounting for 0.35% of the mass at maximum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06480"&gt;8.9-hr Rotation in the Partly Burnt Runaway Stellar Remnant LP 40-365 (GD 492)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Hermes et al.,  2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There exits a class of partly burnt runaway stars, which have been ejected from their binary systems upon a thermonuclear supernova event, LP 40-365 is the prototype of this class. This object is thought to be cause by a subluminous Type Iax supernova that failed to destroy the host star. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors report on an 8.914-hr variability that is evident in both the optical and ultraviolet light curves. The 1% optical variation was first discovered in TESS data, and the 5.8% variation in the UV was detected by the HST. The authors propose that this variation indicates the surface rotation rate and is caused by some sort of inhomogeneity rotating in and out of view, there is no observed Zeeman splitting however and therefore the magnetic field has an upper limit of &amp;lt;20 kG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper goes on to explore how the rotation rate observed could be used to constrain progenitor scenarios, if the angular momentum were mostly conserved. The authors suggest that LP 40-365 was not the donor star of its binary system, but likely the  white dwarf that underwent advanced burning from an underluminous (Type Iax) supernova. See this paper for more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eclipsing systems, especially those with a pulsating component, are vital for the understand the properties of stars and stellar systems, and crucial for precise asteroseismology. With the advent of missions like Kepler and TESS, the detection and characterization of such systems has significantly increased. In this paper the authors present recent results from studies of eclipsing systems with pulsating components based on data from Kepler or TESS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systems examined in this paper include: semi-detached eclipsing binaries in (near-)circular orbits; a (near-)circular and non-synchronized eclipsing binary with a chemically peculiar component; eclipsing binaries showing the heartbeat phenomenon; and detached, eccentric double-lined systems. All display one or more pulsating component(s). Please read this paper for more details on the systems presented.&lt;/p&gt;

The TESS light-curves correspond to the PDC-SAP flux time series provided by SPOC. The TESS full light curve with the 2-minute cadence data is shown in light-grey, and the same data binned to 10 min in dark-grey. The gaps in the data coverage are due to observation interruptions of the TESS spacecraft to send the data to Earth, that occurs after each TESS orbit of 13.7 days. The dots of the LCOGT are bigger for better visualization. The lower panels shows the phase folded TESS light curves for TOI 1062b (left) and TOI 1062c (right) with the 2 min cadence data in light-grey and binned to 10 minutes in black.

&lt;p&gt;Hello TESS followers and welcome to this weeks news bulletin. This week we have three papers from the archive, enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09865"&gt;Detection of an energetic flare from the M5V secondary star in the Polar MQ Dra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Ramsay et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors study TESS observations of MQ Dra, a highly magnetic cataclysmic variable. The MQ Dra system contains a white dwarf that is accreting material at a low rate from its secondary star (type M5V) via stellar winds. TESS has observed this object in four sectors (16,22,23,24) of Cycle 2, with data indicating a short duration, high energy flare of ~10&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt; erg, with a profile that suggests it is coming from the secondary star. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An energetic flare from a polar is a rare event and there is no evidence that this flare changed the light curve of the system following its occurrence. The authors consider if a coronal mass ejection was associated with the flare. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors go on to compare the frequency of flares from the MQ Dra secondary with M dwarf stars and discuss the overall flare rate of stars with rotation periods shorter than 0.2 days. The authors also discuss how fast rotators can generate magnetic fields with low differential rotation rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09519"&gt;Discovery of an Extremely Short Duration Flare from Proxima Centauri Using Millimeter through FUV Observations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(MacGregor et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the 1st of May 2019 an extreme flaring event from Proxima Centauri was discovered by multiple facilities -  ASKAP, ALMA, HST, TESS, and the du Pont Telescope. The Proxima Cen system is an important one since it is our closest exoplanatary system (1.3pc), and has a potentially Earth-mass planet at an equilibrium temperature of ∼230 K. Proxima Cen is also well established as an M-type flare star, and thus it is a benchmark case for studying the effects of such activity on planetary systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flare event itself was the brightest ever detected in the millimeter and far-UV, brightening by a factor of &amp;gt; 1000 in ALMA and &amp;gt; 14000 in HST. Given that the millimeter and FUV continuum emission trace each-other closely during the flare, it suggests that the millimeter emission could act as a proxy for the FUV for stellar flares. This is an important result as it provides a powerful tool to constrain the high energy radiation environments for exoplanets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the optical the emission is much lower at peak and there is a time-delay. Using TESS data a bolometric energy of 10&lt;sup&gt;31.2&lt;/sup&gt; erg was measured by Vida et. al., (2019). TESS has also observed 71 other flares from Proxima Cen with similar energies (10&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; - 10&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; erg) across 50 days of observations (Howard et. al., 2018). All data indicates that the May flare is common in the optical, but extreme in the millimeter and FUV which in turn suggests that the optical intensity does not necessarily scale to flare energies at other wavelengths and demonstrates the utility of multi-wavelength coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial burst has an extremely short duration, lasting for less than 10 seconds. Taken together with the growing sample of millimeter M dwarf flares, this event suggests that millimeter emission is actually common during stellar flares and often originates from short burst-like events. See this paper for more information in addition to the &lt;a href="https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/news/1680/neighboring-stars-bad-behavior-large-and-frequent-flares/"&gt;NASA news feature&lt;/a&gt; on the system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07627"&gt;V680 Mon -- a young mercury-manganese star in an eclipsing heartbeat system&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Paunzen et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using spectra from the Large Sky AreaMulti-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope, in addition to their own observations, the authors of this paper have identified the primary component of V680 Mon (an eclipsing binary system), as a chemically peculiar (CP) star. Specifically the CP star is of the mercury-manganese (HgMn/CP3) group, with a spectral type kB9 hB8 HeB9 V HgMn. This is a rather homogeneous group which is identified by the presence of strong Hg II and Mn II lines in the optical spectra and occupy the restricted spectral-type range between B6 and A0. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time series data from TESS has also indicated that the system is a "heartbeat star", a rare class of eccentric binary stars with short periods which have a characteristic signature near the time of periastron in the light curves due to the tidal distortion of the components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using all data and ELISa, the authors update the ephemeris and binary system parameters, deriving a  secondary star effective temperature is 8300 K (spectral type A4). This system is relatively rare with V680 Mon being the fifth know eclipsing mercury-manganese CP star, and the first in a "heartbeat" binary. Please see the paper for more information about this system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello TESS followers and welcome to this weeks news bulletin. First we have a "birthday card" for TESS, acknowledging its 3rd year since launch and some of its spectacular detections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Birthday" src="images/Birthday.pdf" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now onto our main feature, this week we have three papers from the archive, enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05653"&gt;Hot planets around cool stars -- two short-period mini-Neptunes transiting the late K-dwarf TOI-1260&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Georgieva et, al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors present the discovery of two sub-Neptune sized planets in a close orbit around the host star, TOI-1260 - a low metallicity K6V dwarf star. Evidence also indicates that there may be an additional planet of a similar size, in a larger orbit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilizing TESS photometry the radii of the two inner planets are derived as, R&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.33 R⊕ and R&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.82 R⊕, with periods of 3.13 and 7.49 days for TOI-1260b and TOI-1260c, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When combining the TESS data with precision radial velocities from HARPS-N, the authors were able to characterize the planetary system, obtaining mass estimates of M&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; = 8.61 M⊕ and M&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;=11.84 M⊕. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The star was determined as moderately active with a complex activity pattern and as such required the use of Gaussian Process (GP) regression for both the light curve detrending and the radial velocity modeling (see the paper for more detail on this method). Using GP the authors successfully disentangled the stellar-induced signal from the planetary signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06448"&gt;Highly structured inner planetary system debris around the intermediate age Sun-like star TYC 8830 410 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Melis et, al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TYC 8830 410 1 is an extremely dusty G9V main sequence star, which hosts inner planetary system dust. This dust has a temperature of ~300 K, a fractional infrared luminosity of ~1%, and a mildy-crystalline sold-state emission feature is shown via mid-infrared spectroscopy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system is ~600 Myrs old and has an M4-type companion star that is 49.5" away and is co-moving and co-distant. A "dipper-like" dimming effect is also exhibited in the system as detected via ASAS-SN, TESS, and LCOGT, this is likely due to a star-sized cloud of dust orbiting the star in addition to smaller dust structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the extreme properties of the material it is likely that dramatic dust production mechanisms were at play, including something similar to a giant impact event like that which formed the Earth-Moon system. Further investigation of this system will deliver significant advances in our understanding of the origin, structure, and evolution of extremely dusty inner planetary systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06944"&gt;TESS observations of TX Col: Rapidly varying accretion flow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Rawat et, al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using data from the TESS mission the authors have examined the intermediate polar TX CoI. A detailed time-resolved timing analysis was conducted, and the power spectra of the 52 day continuous time series indicated an orbital period of  5.691 hr, spin period of 1909.5 s, and beat period of 2105.76 s, consistent with previously obtained results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors also detected the presence of quasi-periodic oscillations for a few days with periods of  5850-5950 s. These QPOs appear to be due to the beating of the Keplerian period with the spin period of the white dwarf. Using the TESS data the authors  examined the evolution of the systems accretion geometry and found that TX Col changes its accretion mechanism each day, thus confirming its variable disk-overflow accretion nature.

&lt;p&gt;Hello TESS followers and welcome to this weeks news bulletin. This week we have three papers from the archive, enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15322"&gt;The first photometric investigation and spectroscopic analysis of two contact binaries: ASAS J124343+1531.7 and LINEAR 2323566&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Xia et, al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors examine data for ASAS J124343+1531.7 and LINEAR 2323566, obtaining key system parameters. The multi-color passband CCD light curves were first obtained  by the 0.84m Ritchey-Chrétien telescope with follow up observations by the WIYN 0.90m Cassegrain telescope, and additional observations obtained by TESS. Taking all data and passing it through the W-D program the authors were able to obtain the mass ratios and fill-out factors for the systems as 3.758, 1.438 and 31.8%, 14.9%, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two systems are both binaries, ASAS J124343+1531.7 is a W-subtype median contact binary, while LINEAR 2323566 is a W-subtype shallow contact binary. The O'Connell effect is indicated in both systems as they have asymmetric light curves. This effect is typically explained by magnetic activity, which was confirmed by the authors when measuring the equivalent widths of the h-alpha lines. The system LINEAR 2323566, was also found to have the strongest magnetic activity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When examining the orbital period changes the authors found that ASAS J124343+1531.7 seems to have a secular period increase, which can be explained by the transfer of mass from a less massive star to a more massive star. In ASAS J124343+1531.7 the two stars are thought to be in the main sequence. For LINEAR 2323566 however,  the more massive star is a main sequence star, while the less massive star has evolved out of the main sequence and is over-luminous and over-sized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.17192"&gt;Exploring the pulsational properties of two ZZ Ceti stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Bognár et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ZZ Ceti star is a type of pulsating white dwarf variable. The luminosity variation is thought to be caused by non-radial gravity wave pulsations within the white dwarf itself. In this paper the authors continue their ground-based observing project with  season long observations of these unique variables using the Konkoly Observatory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targets observed include PM J22299+3024 and LP 119-10, which was also observed by TESS with a 120 second cadence. Using standard Fourier analysis of the data sets (in addition to test data) and asteroseismic fits, the authors derived six possible pulsation modes for PM J22299+3024, and five plus two TESS pulsation frequencies for LP 119-10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The asteroseismic fits of PM J22299+3024 gave an effective temperature of 11,400 K and a stellar mass of 0.46 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;. This temperated is roughly 800 K higher than the values derived by spectroscopy, but the mass has remained the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For LP 119-10 the effective temperature is between 11,800 - 11,900 K, and the stellar mass is 0.7 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;. This temperature is once again higher than that assumed from spectroscopy (11,290 K), and the mass is relatively similar 0.65 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seismic distances of the authors best-fitting model stars agree with the Gaia astrometric distances of PM J22299+3024 and LP 119-10, within errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A warm Jupiter is defined here as a planet that is larger than six Earth radii with an orbital period between 8-200 days. These planets are important as we still don't fully understand how they form, with different origin channels having mean different expectations for a warm Jupiters' properties. Evaluating the overall properties of warm Jupiters'  however is difficult because of the small sample size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors take advantage of TESS year 1 prime mission FFI data, systematically searching for candidates around main sequence host stars that are brighter than 12th magnitude. A catalog of 55 warm Jupiter candidates are introduced, including 19 candidates that were not originally released as TESS Objects of Interest. The authors fit these light curves and then characterize their eccentricities and transit-timing variations (TTVs). After evaluation a list was then created which prioritized those more suitable for ground-based follow-up and via the TESS Extended Mission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors then used hierarchical Bayesian modeling to find the preliminary eccentricity distributions of their warm Jupiter sample using Beta distribution. See the paper for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello TESS followers and welcome to this weeks news bulletin. This week we have three papers from the archive, enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12538"&gt;The TESS Objects of Interest Catalog from the TESS Prime Mission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Guerrero et, al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper presents the 2,241 exoplanet candidates identified by TESS during its primary mission. These objects are all listed within the TESS Object of Interest (TOI) catalog which includes all new planet candidates discovered by TESS and previously-known planets recovered by TESS observations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper discusses the process that is used to identify TOIs and how to investigate the characteristics of the candidate planets found. The paper also discusses some of the more interesting TESS planet discoveries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper goes on to address the large number of small planet candidates around nearby bright stars that are perfect for detailed follow-up observations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13540"&gt;Activity of TRAPPIST-1 analogue stars observed with TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Seli et, al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More and more exoplanets are being discovered around ultracool dwarfs, as such understanding their magnetic activity and so their implication for habitability is of vital importance. Continuous monitoring by a facility such as TESS is required to study these stars for flares and starspots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper goes on to present an analysis of TRAPPIST-1 like ultracool dwarfs using TESS FFI data from the prime mission. The sample consists of 339 stars which are closer than 0.5 mag to TRAPPIST-1 on the Gaia colour-magnitude diagram. Of these data 248 stars were analyzed for flares and rotational modulation caused by starspots, resulting in 94 flare detections. The composite flare frequency distribution shows a power law index similar to TRAPPIST-1, and contains flares up to ETESS=3×10&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; erg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rotational periods shorter than 5 days were also determined for 42 stars, which samples the regime of fast rotators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 88 stars in the sample the ages were estimated using kinematic information and a weak correlation between rotational periods and age was observed - consistent with magnetic breaking. Please read this paper for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12760"&gt;Two Bright M Dwarfs Hosting Ultra-Short-Period Super-Earths with Earth-like Compositions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Hirano et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper presents the observations of two bright M-dwarf stars, TOI-1634 and TOI-1685, which have J-band magnitudes between 9.5 - 9.6, and similar masses, temperatures, and radii. These stars are thought to be ultra-short period (USP) planet candidates, and were identified by TESS, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using both space and ground-based photometry, orbital periods of P = 0.9893457  day and P = 0.6691425 day were determined for TOI-1634 b and TOI-1685 b, respectively. Radial velocity measurements from the IRAD Spectrograph on Subaru were then used to confirm the planetary nature of the objects and the masses measured as 9.94 M⊕ for TOI-1634b and 3.84 M⊕ for TOI-1685 b. The radii of the planets wee determined as Rp=1.773 R⊕  for TOI-1634 b, and 1.463 R⊕ for TOI-1685 b. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining the radii and masses of the planets these USP objects have mean densities consistent with an Earth like internal composition, which is typical for small USP planets. See this fascinating paper for more information, including the discussion of a possible secondary planet in the TOI-1685 system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello TESS followers and welcome to this weeks news bulletin. This week we have three papers from the archive, enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09216"&gt;Temperature and Distance Dependence of Tidal Circularization in Close Binaries: A Catalog of Eclipsing Binaries in the Southern Hemisphere Observed by the TESS Satellite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Justesen et, al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stars in close binary systems can experience tidal forces. Understanding these forces is important as they increase our knowledge regarding  the formation and evolution of close binaries. Modeling tides is however very difficult, and significant uncertainties exist around their strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors investigate tidal circularization in close binaries by using a sample of well characterized TESS southern hemisphere eclipsing systems. By combining light curves and spectral energy distributions, the authors have derived the best-fit orbital and stellar parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TESS data, in combination with data from Kepler and other ground-based facilities, were used to determine the eccentricity distributions of eclipsing binaries over a wide range of stellar temperatures (3000 - 50,000 K) and orbital separations (a/R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = 2-300). A clear dependency between stellar temperatures and orbital separations in the eccentricities of the close binaries was found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors go on to compare their observations with predictions of the equilibrium and dynamical tides. They find that cool binaries tend to agree with the predictions of equilibrium tide, but that warmer binaries i.e., those between 6,250K and 10,000K and which have an orbital separation of ~ 4-10, are found on circular obits and so contradict predictions of dynamical tides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper goes on to suggest that some binaries radiative envelopes may be tidally circularised significantly more efficiently than usually assumed. Please read this fascinating paper for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09725"&gt;GG Carinae: Discovery of orbital phase dependent 1.583-day periodicities in the B[e] supergiant binary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Porter et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GG Carinae is a binary system with an  orbital period of ~31 days, and a B[e] supergiant primary. Using photometry from TESS, ASAS, OMC, and ASAS-SN, in addition to spectroscopy from the Global Jet Watch, the authors investigate the short term variability exhibited by the binary. 
A previously unknown periodicity of 1.583156 days was derived, and present in both the photometry and the radial velocities of the emission lines (He I, Fe II, Si II). The amplitudes of the short period variations in the photometry, and in some of the emission lines, are modulated by the orbital period of the binary. This makes it such that the short-period variations have the largest amplitudes when the binary is at periastron. The authors find that there are no significant changes in the phase of the short period variations over the orbital period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1.583-day variability tends to agree well with the expected period of the 𝑙 = 2 f-mode of the primary given its mass and radius. The authors explain this could be cause by the primary being periodically pulled out of hydrostatic equilibrium by quadrupolar tidal forces when the components are near periastron in the binary’s eccentric orbit (𝑒 = 0.5) and the primary almost fills its Roche lobe. This effect would cause an oscillation at the 𝑙 = 2 f-mode frequency which is damped as the distance between the components increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09746"&gt;TESS re-observes the young multi-planet system TOI-451: refined ephemeris and activity evolution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Barragán et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TOI 451 is a young star that is host to three planets. In this paper the authors present a new analysis of the system using TESS Cycle 3 data. This new analysis of the transits of the three planets has improved the ephemeris of TOI 451 b and TOI 451 c, which will aid in future followup observations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Updated mid-transit times are BJD − 2, 457 000 =1410.9896, 1411.7982 , and 1416.63407 for TOI451 b, c, and d, respectively, and the periods are 1.8587028 , 9.192453 , and 16.364932 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Gaussian Processes the out-of-transit light curve is also modeled with a quasi-periodic kernel. The results of this analysis indicate a change in the properties of the active regions on the surface of the host between Cycles 1 and 3. Please see this paper for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01016"&gt;An ultra-short-period transiting super-Earth orbiting the M3 dwarf TOI-1685&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Bluhm, et al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By studying ultra-short period planets scientists may gain insight into the dynamical histories of planetary systems, as well as the atmospheric evolution of highly irradiated planets. In this paper the authors follow-up a transit signal detected in Sector 19 of the TESS data, which occurs around an M3 V star. The authors confirm the planetary nature of the signal and derive the following planetary parameters: period = 0.6691403 days (using radial velocity measurements from CARMENS spectrograph), mass = 3.78 M&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;, radius = 1.70 R&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;, a bulk density of rho = 4.21 g cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;, and T&lt;sub&gt;equlibrium&lt;/sub&gt; = 1069 K. This planet, TOI-1685 b, is the least dense ultra-short period planet around an M dwarf known to date. The authors also detect another non-transiting planet candidate, TOI-1685 c, which has an orbital period of 9.02 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00925"&gt;BG Ind: the nearest doubly eclipsing, compact hierarchical quadruple system&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Borkovits et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BG Ind is a well known bright binary system which consists of a pair of F stars in a 14.6 day orbit. In this paper the authors use TESS data to discover a second eclipsing binary in the system with a period of 0.53 days. Utilizing a combination of TESS photometry and archival ground-based photometric and radial velocity data, the authors find that the two binaries are gravitationally bound in a 721 day period with a moderately eccentric orbit. A detailed study of several data sets, including TESS, confirms the results of prior studies in which the brighter binary system A, consists of slightly evolved F-type stars with masses of 1.32 M⊙ and 1.43 M⊙, and radii of 1.59 R⊙ and 2.34 R⊙. The newly discovered binary system B, possesses less massive stars of 0.69 M⊙ and 0.64 M⊙, and radii of 0.64 R⊙ and 0.61 R⊙. The authors conclude that the three orbital planes are likely aligned to within 17”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03041"&gt;Exploring the tilted accretion disc of AQ Men with TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Ilkiewicz et al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AQ Men is a nova-like variable with a suspected tilted, precessing accretion disc. The geometry of this system can be explored through the examination of grazing eclipses. In this paper the authors have analyzed TESS data of AQ Men, creating some of the best light curves of this system to date. From these data the authors find that the depths of the eclipses change with the orientation of the disc, meaning that these eclipses can be used as a direct test of the tilted accretion disc models. Further analysis indicates that the precession period of the accretion disc varies, as does the shape of the variability. A positive superhump has also been detected that was previously unseen in AQ Men. This positive superhump has a strongly non-sinusoidal shape, which is not expected for a nova-like variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05647"&gt;NEMESIS: Exoplanet Transit Survey of Nearby M-Dwarfs in TESS FFIs I&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Feliz et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:
Using TESS full frame images from Sector 1 - 5 the authors have examined 33,054 M-dwarf stars within 100 parsecs. This analysis was conducted with a new pipeline called NEMESIS which was developed to extract de-trended photometry and perform transit searches of single sector data in TESS FFIs. These data can be used to provide an empirical validation of how many planets are missed by using 30 min cadence data. Using this pipeline the authors detect 183 threshold crossing events and 29 planet candidates, 24 of which are new detections. The orbital periods of the sample range from 1.25 - 6.84 days, and radii from 1.26 - 5.31 R&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;. Combining these new detections with the previous detections from Sectors 1 - 5, an integrated occurrence rate of 2.49 planets per star for the period range between 1-9 days, and planet radii between 0.5-11 R&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;, is determined. The authors then go on to project an estimated yield of 122 transit detections of near by M-dwarfs.

&lt;strong&gt;Fig. 1:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Taken from Bluhm, et al., (2021). Upper panels: TESS PDCSAP light curve of TOI-1685 and the corresponding phase-folded light curve. Lower panels: phase-folded light curves of LCOGT, PESTO, and MuSCAT2 in filter i and zs of TOI-1685. For all phase-folded light curves the residuals are shown for the USP found in the system. White circles are binned data (shown only for reference). Black curves are the best-fit models, and light and dark blue areas are the 68 % and 95 % credibility bands. The different sizes of the MuSCAT2 error bars correspond to the two observing night.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fig. 2:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Taken from Borkovits, et al., (2021). Folded, binned, and averaged TESS light curves of the two binaries of the quadruple system BG Ind. Upper panel: Sector 1 light curve of binary A (blue circles), together with the folded, binned, and averaged combined spectro-photodynamical model light curve (red curve). Middle and lower panels: Year 1 (Sector 1) and Year 3 (Sector 27 and 28) light curves of binary B, respectively. The red solution curve exhibits some small extra fluctuations that are probably due to the chromospheric/photospheric activities of the stars. These were modelled mathematically with Fourier-harmonics simultaneously with the two-binary model, while the thin grey curves represent the pure two-binary part of the same solution. The fold of the residuals to the models are also shown below the folded light curves.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We would like to take this opportunity to inform you, the community, of a new High Level Science Product (HLSP) being released at  &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu"&gt;MAST&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/hlsp/tica"&gt;TICA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2515-5172/abd63a"&gt;(Fausnaugh et al. 2020)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TICA provides a calibrated version of TESS full frame images (FFIs). These FFIs are the same products used by the TESS Science Office at MIT to create the &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.stsci.edu/hlsp/qlp&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1614893557574000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw10KvxqkSyHfpCT95L4I8VV"&gt;QLP&lt;/a&gt;-extracted light curves, also provided as an HLSP at MAST.  TICA is able to process a full ~13.7-day orbit of FFIs within ~1 day of the data being downloaded to the ground.  In principle, this allows for “quick-look” calibrated versions of the FFIs for an orbit to be made public to the TESS community up to several weeks earlier than the full ~27-day Sector’s worth of standard mission products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To trial rapid release of TESS data, the calibrated TICA FFIs from the first orbit of Sector 35 will be released early to the community as an HLSP on &lt;strong&gt;Monday, March 8th&lt;/strong&gt;. These data will be made public earlier than the standard mission products, and thus &lt;strong&gt;will be the first release of calibrated pixel data for this Sector&lt;/strong&gt;. The standard mission products for this and all following sectors will still be delivered to the community on the nominal timeline. This activity is being conducted as a “beta” trial, to test a process through which “quick-look” calibrated images could be expeditiously released to the community on an orbit-by-orbit basis, instead of waiting for a full Sector (two orbits) to be completed and processed.  This will allow our TESS community to more rapidly begin analysis, plan follow-up observations, or search for transients and moving targets.  It will also reduce the impact associated with the delay between TESS observations being completed and the data being made public, such as the decay of exoplanet orbital ephemerides or the seasonal availability of telescope time to conduct follow-up in that Sector’s region of the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Will Be Provided As Part Of This Beta Trial?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TICA-calibrated FFIs from the first orbit of Sector 35 will be made available for download from the &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/hlsp/tica"&gt;TICA HLSP&lt;/a&gt; webpage.  The files will be made available to download using &lt;a href="https://curl.se"&gt;curl&lt;/a&gt; scripts, which will allow users to download the full set of FITS images, or select a subset of FITS images to retrieve.  These curl scripts will function in a similar way to those provided as bulk downloads for the mission-produced products.  Many users will find curl already installed on their machines, if not, the software is open source and freely available to install.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contents Of This Beta Trial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The astrometric solutions from the TICA-calibrated images typically differ from those provided by the standard TESS mission products by less than 2 arc seconds. Similarly, the TESS magnitudes of individual objects typically differ by less than 1 millimagnitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only the calibrated TICA FFis will be made available, thus serving as a quick-look version of the data.  The raw data will not be included as part of this activity, and the release does not include light curves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TICA FFis will only be available for download using the bulk scripts on the HLSP page at MAST.  The TICA files will not be available through the MAST Portal, through the MAST API or astroquery.mast, and will not be available for use in TESSCut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are quick-look products, thus the same level of documentation and support will not be available as for the standard mission products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only Sector 35, Orbit 1 will be released as part of this beta trial.  Similar quick-look, single orbit early-releases beyond Sector 35 Orbit 1 will be re-assessed by the mission at a later date, based in part on feedback from the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Will Change With The Standard Sector 35 Release?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing will change in terms of the release of the standard Sector 35 products.  When the full Sector of data is processed, it will be released in its entirety at MAST following the normal process, including being made available through the MAST Portal, the MAST APIs, bulk scripts, and TESSCut.&lt;/p&gt;

This week we present three papers from the archive, enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11640"&gt;Mass and density of the transiting hot and rocky super-Earth LHS 1478 b (TOI-1640 b)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Soto et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors present the confirmation and characterization of a super-Earth planet transiting TOI-1640. The host star is an inactive red dwarf with a J-band magnitude of 9.6, a mass of 0.2 M⊙, a radius of 0.25 R⊙, and an effective temperature of 3381 K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using four sectors of TESS data a transit-like feature was detected with a period of 1.949 days. Utilizing 57 radial-velocity (RV) measurements from CARMENES, and 13 RV measurements from IRD, the authors determine that the signal is produced by a planet that has a mass of 2.33 M⊕ and a radius of 1.24R⊕. The bulk density of the planet is 6.66 g cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; which is consistent with a rocky planet with a Fe and MgSiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; dominated composition. See this fascinating paper for more information about the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11295"&gt;GRB 191016A: A Long Gamma-Ray Burst Detected by TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Smith et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only can TESS be used for discovering new exoplanets, it can also be used to detect many types of transients - producing high cadenced light cures of energetic events such as Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such event is GRB 191016A, a long Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) which was detected by Swift-BAT. The peak afterglow of this long GRB was at least 1000 seconds after the BAT trigger, with the brightest TESS data point occurring 2589.7 seconds post trigger. The GRB was not detected by  Fermi-LAT, but was detected by Fermi-GBM without triggering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From ground-based photometry a photometric redshift of 3.29 was derived. Using the high-energy emission and optical peak time derived from TESS data, an estimated Lorentz factor between 90-133 was calculated. The GRB is quite bright and has a peak optical R-band magnitude of 15.1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper focuses on the use of an artificial intelligence (AI) technique that uses machine learning (ML) to find exoplanets in the TESS data. The machine learning methodologies combine several algorithms developed by &lt;a href="https://thetaray.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ThetaRay, Inc&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The technique was initially trained on Kepler exoplanet data, and validated with the confirmed candidates. The technique was then applied to the TESS data, specifically 10,803 light curves of threshold crossing events. From these data the authors find 39 new exoplanet candidates targets.&lt;/p&gt;
