Our first cycle deadline is anticipated to be in early approximately October, with the in-person peer review likely taking place in early December. We are currently looking for volunteers with expertise in astrophysics and exoplanet science to serve on our review panel. The requirements are that you have a PhD or relevant experience (so this opportunity isn't open to Grad Students), and that you are not intending to PI a TESS Cycle 1 proposal (it's fine you later choose to submit a proposal, but we would then not invite you to the review). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please get in touch by sending you name, institution to areas of expertise &lt;a href="mailto:tessgi@bigbang.gsfc.nasa.gov"&gt;tessgi@bigbang.gsfc.nasa.gov&lt;/a&gt;, or filling in &lt;a href="https://goo.gl/forms/p4ZqiTQSEHjbM6nz2"&gt;this form&lt;/a&gt;. As a guide, we are anticipating on having panels made up of an approximately 50/50 split between postdocs and more senior scientist. Topics we are particularly interesting in recruiting reviewers for are exoplanet science, asteroseismology, stellar activity, binary stars, and supernova observations. &lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Tell us about the software tool and data products you would like</title><link href="https://tessgi.gsfc.nasa.gov/tell-us-about-the-software-tool-and-data-products-you-would-like.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-04-21T14:01:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-04-21T14:01:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Tom Barclay</name></author><id>tag:tessgi.gsfc.nasa.gov,2017-04-21:/tell-us-about-the-software-tool-and-data-products-you-would-like.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The TESS Community Science Cneter at NASA Goddard are currently collecting input from the scientific community on what you would like to see developed.
