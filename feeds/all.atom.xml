&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers!  This week we are looking at three papers from the archive, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02912"&gt;OO Dra: an Algol-type binary formed through an extremely helium-poor mass accretion revealed by asteroseismology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Chen et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OO Dra is an eclipsing binary with an orbital period of 1.23838 days. Eclipsing binaries are important objects as they help us to understand stellar structure and evolution. 
Using TESS 2-minute cadenced data, the authors have analyzed the intrinsic oscillations of the primary component and identified seven confident and independent delta Scuti frequencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-star evolutionary models and mass-accreting models are computed to reproduce delta Scuti frequencies, with the fitting of residuals matching well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through asteroseismology the  authors determine the stellar parameters of the primary as M = 1.92 M⊙, Z = 0.011, R = 2.068 R⊙, log g = 4.090, T = 8346 K, and L = 18.65 L⊙. These parameters match well with the dynamical parameters of the binary model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The asteroseismology results also indicate that OO Dra is an Algol system which has undergone the rapid mass-transfer stage. The pulsator is likely a helium poor star with an age of 8.22 Myr, and that the primary is probably an un-evolved star formed by an extremely helium-poor mass accretion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02310"&gt;TOI-431/HIP 26013: a super-Earth and a sub-Neptune transiting a bright, early K dwarf, with a third RV planet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Osborn et al.,  2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors present the discovery of TOI-431, a bright, multi-planet system which has a stellar rotation period is 30.5 days. The system has been studied by the authors using radial velocity measurements and photometry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orbiting the host there are three planets,  a super-Earth known as TOI-431b, a sub-Neptune known as TOI-431d, and TOI-431c which was not seen to transit the host. 
TOI-431b has a period of 0.49 days, a radius of 1.28 R⊕, a mass of 3.07 M⊕, and a density of 8.0 g cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;. 
TOI-431d has a period of 12.46 days, a radius of 3.29 R⊕, a mass of 9.90 M⊕, and a density of 1.36 g cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;. This planet is also likely to have an extended atmosphere.
TOI-431c has an M sin i  of 2.83 M⊕, and a period of 4.85 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All planets straddle the radius gap and present an interesting case-study for atmospheric evolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02294"&gt;TESS Giants Transiting Giants I: A Non-inflated Hot Jupiter Orbiting a Massive Subgiant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Saunders et. al.,  2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of confirmed transiting exoplanets around evolved stars is still relatively low. This paper presents the discovery and characterization of a hot Jupiter orbiting a massive evolved sub-giant star, designated TOI-2184. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The host star has a mass of 1.53M⊙, a radius of  2.90 R⊙, and is located in the TESS southern continuous viewing zone. Due to periodic systematics which introduced spurious transit depth differences, this planet was originally flagged as a false positive by the TESS Quick-look Pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a new pipeline, which removes the scattered light rom the TESS full frame images (FFIs), the authors combined the TESS photometry with that from the ground in addition to radial velocity measurements. From this work a planet radius of 1.017 R&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt; and mass of 0.65 M&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, were derived. The mass and radius obtained are very close to that of Jupiter, and given the planets close proximity to its host star, this is unusual. The planet is in fact smaller than what is theoretically predicted based on the incident flux. See this paper for more information. &lt;/p&gt;

Top plot: detrending the TESS light curves and fitting models for TOI-431 b and c. Top: the full, 2-min cadence PDCSAP light curve, with no detrending for stellar activity, is shown in grey. Each sector has 2 segments of continuous viewing, and the gaps in the data correspond to the spacecraft down-linking the data to Earth after a TESS orbit of 13.7 days. Overlaid in green is the GP model that has been fit to this data (described in Section 3.2.1 of the paper), in order to detrend the stellar activity . Middle: the flux detrended with the GP model, with the transit models for TOI-431 b (orange) and d (blue) overlaid. The expected transit times for the 2 further transits of TOI-431 d, both of which fall in the data down-link, are marked with blue arrows. Bottom: residuals when the best fit model and GP have been subtracted from the PDCSAP flux. The baseline flux (normalized to 0) is shown in dark grey. Bottom plot: phase folds of the TESS data for TOI-431 b (left), c (middle, with no transit evident), and d (right), with the flux binned as red circles, and the residuals of the folds once the best fit models have been subtracted from the flux shown in the bottom panels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The alternating triangle colors represent the even and odd transits. The gray sections mark the data gaps due to data downlinks or the spacecraft entering safe mode. While the even transits (blue) fall almost exclusively in the middle of continuous data collection, the odd transits (orange) fall primarily near the beginning or end of a data gap when the TESS detector is experiencing increased scatter due to thermal sensitivity variation and scattered light. This trend is most present in the first seven observing sectors (top two rows), and disappears for the final four sectors (bottom row)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="news"></category></entry><entry><title>TESS Weekly Bulletin: August 10th</title><link href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/tess-weekly-bulletin-august-10th.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-08-10T10:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2021-08-10T10:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Rebekah Hounsell</name></author><id>tag:heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov,2021-08-10:/docs/tess/tess-weekly-bulletin-august-10th.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;STATUS UPDATE: Check out our new&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/gallery.html"&gt;outreach products&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers!  This week we are looking at three papers from the archive, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14737"&gt;A Second Planet Transiting LTT~1445A and a Determination of the Masses of Both Worlds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Winters et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers!  This week we are looking at three papers from the archive, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14737"&gt;A Second Planet Transiting LTT~1445A and a Determination of the Masses of Both Worlds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Winters et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors present the discovery of a new world orbiting LTT 1445A, the primary star in a hierarchical triple M-dwarf star system located at a distance of 6.86 parsecs. The star is roughly a quarter the mass of our Sun, and is known to host LTT 1445Ab, a transiting planet with an orbital period of 5.4 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second planet, LTT 1445Ac,  was discovered by the authors using TESS data, and was found to have an orbital period of 3.1 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilizing radial velocity measurements taken from additional facilities, the mass and radius of the two planet were determined.  LTT 1445Ab  has a mass of 2.87 M&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;  and a radius of 1.304 R&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;, consistent with an Earth-like composition of 33% iron and 67% magnesium silicate. LTT 1445Ac has a mass of 1.54 M&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;   (0.161 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;) and a minimum radius of 1.15 R&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The orbits of the two planets are consistent with being circular, but they are mutually inclined by at least 2.25 degrees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photometry and spectroscopy of the three stars in the system indicate that LTT 1445C ((0.161 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;)is likely the source of the 1.4 day rotation period, whilst LTT 1445B (0.215 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;) has a rotation period of 6.7 days. The planet host star, LTT 1445A, has a likely rotation period of 85 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All data collected on this triple M-dwarf system, indicate that it is in a special evolutionary stage where the most massive M dwarf has spun down, the intermediate mass M dwarf is in the process of spinning down, while the least massive stellar component has not yet begun to spin down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14125"&gt;A large sub-Neptune transiting the thick-disk M4V TOI-2406&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Wells et al.,  2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors report on the discovery and validation of a sub-Neptune planet orbiting TOI-2406, a mid-M dwarf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The host star properties were inferred using its near-infrared spectrum, spectral energy distribution, and Gaia parallax measurement. The host was found to be a metal-poor M4V star, at a distance of 56 pc, with a sub-solar metallically of [Fe/H] = -0.38, and is a member of the thick disc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multi-band photometry were used to confirm that the transit event is on-target and achromatic, and the authors statistically validated the TESS signal as a transiting exoplanet. Planet properties were determined via a global transit model of the TESS and ground-based time-series data. The planet is a relatively large sub-Neptune for the M-dwarf population, has a radius of 2.94 R⊕, a period of 3.077 days, and a transit depth of 2%. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large sub-Neptune planets don't tend to occur around the cooler stars in the Galaxy, and it is even more unlikely when those stars are metal-poor.  This system is therefore very interesting and presents  a benchmark for large-planet formation around metal-poor, low-mass stars. Please see the paper for more information about this fascinating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13670"&gt;TOI-532b: The Habitable-zone Planet Finder confirms a Large Super Neptune in the Neptune Desert orbiting a metal-rich M dwarf host&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Kanodia et. al.,  2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TOI-532b has been confirmed as a planet using a combination of  precise near-infrared radial velocities with the Habitable-zone Planet Finder, TESS light curves, ground-based photometric follow-up, and high-contrast imaging. Examination of these data has led to the determination that TOI-532 is a faint, metal-rich M dwarf, with an effective temperature of 3957 K, and a metallicity of  [Fe/H] = 0.38. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The star is host to a transiting gaseous planet with a period of 2.3 days, radius of 5.82 R⊕, and a mass of 61.5 M⊕. This planet is the most massive  super Neptune detected around an M dwarf with both mass and radius measurements, and it bridges the gap between the Neptune-sized planets and the heavier Jovian planets known to orbit M dwarfs.  See this paper for more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

The 2-minute data points (grey) have been binned by 15 to produce the black points, with error bars corresponding to the standard deviation in the bins, which match the FFI light curve cadence of 30 min. Regions marked in red were excluded from the analysis: In Sector 3, there were poor-quality engineering data between orbits; and in Sector 30, a significant trend at the end was possibly caused by scattered light. Regions marked in grey correspond to data taken outside of science data acquisition for testing purposes but used in the analysis. One transit occurred in this period, towards the end of Sector 3. The transits of TOI-2406 b are labelled with green markers below the light curves.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers to this weeks news bulletin. This week we are looking at three papers from the archive, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers to this weeks news bulletin. This week we are looking at three papers from the archive, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06293"&gt;EvryFlare IV: Detection of periodicity in flare occurrence from cool stars with TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Howard et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The periodic occurrence of stellar flares may used as a probe into electromagnetic star-planet interaction (SPI), binary interaction, or magnetic conditions in spots. In this paper the authors utilize high-cadenced two minute TESS data in order to study a sample of 284 cool stars and their flare periodograms. Using these data the authors seek to identify periodicity due to magnetic interactions with orbiting companions, magnetic reservoirs, or due to rotational phase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking this large sample of stars, periods from 1-10 days are searched for using newly developed periodograms. These periodograms are a new Bayesian likelihood periodogram and a modified Lomb-Scargle periodogram, and been constructed by the authors to better account for phased flaring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper finds six candidates with a false alarm probability below 1%, three targets are grater than 3-sigma detections of flare periodicity; the others are plausible candidates which cannot be individually confirmed. See the paper for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06254"&gt;Directly Determined Properties of HD 97658 from Interferometric Observations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Ellis et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HD 97658 is host to a super-Earth known as HD 97658 b, utilizing interferometric observations taken by the CHARA Array, the authors measure the hosts limb-darkened angular diameter to be θLD = 0.314 mas. Combining this measurement with the Gaia EDR3 parallax value (with the zero-point correction) yields a stellar radius of 0.728 R⊙.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bolometric flux of the star is measured as 2.42 ± 0.05 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-8&lt;/sup&gt; erg s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;, and the effective temperature derived as 5212 K, these values agree with previous estimates based on spectroscopy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors go on to use their derived measurements in combination with stellar evolution models and transit properties to determine the age of the system and constrain the properties of the planet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TESS observed the system during Sector 22 for approximately 23 days, with a two minute cadence.  Using the PDCSAP_Flux the authors evaluated the time-series for signs of rotation  due to star-spots passing in and out of the field of view. They found that the average brightness of HD 97658 is stable with a RMS of 385 ppm, and so no evidence of long-term variability due to spots during the observation period. This conclusion is consistent with TESS observation period being shorter than the derived rotation period of 34 days (Guo et al. 2020).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TESS data were also used to search for transits via a Box Least-Squares periodogram. This allowed for the detection of the super-Earth HD97658 b, with an approximate period of 9.474 d. These data were combined with that from EXOFASTv2 to derive several additional planet parameters such as the radius 2.12 R⊕, effective temperature 750 K, and mass 7.5 M⊕.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TESS and  EXOFASTv2  data also revealed a potential additional planet. Please see the paper for more information about this system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05430"&gt;TOI-1749: an M dwarf with a Trio of Planets including a Near-Resonant Pair&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Fukui et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors report on the discovery of a super-Earth, TOI-1749b, and two sub-Neptunes TOI-1749c and TOI-1749d, all transiting an early M dwarf star at a distance of 100 pc. All planets were discovered using TESS data, and confirmed using ground-based measurements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors find that TOI-1749b, c, and d have orbital periods of 2.39, 4.49, and 9.05 days, and radii of 1.4, 2.1, and 2.5 R⊕, respectively. They also place 95\% confidence upper limits on the masses of the planets with estimates of 57, 14, and 15 M⊕ for TOI-1749b, c, and d, respectively, derived via transit timing variations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the parameters derived, the authors hypothesize that all three planets initially had a hydrogen envelope on top of a rocky core, and only the envelope of the innermost planet has been stripped away by photo-evaporation and/or core-powered mass loss mechanisms. Please see this paper for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

Periodicity from these flare stars was detected with the authors newly-developed flare periodograms. Flares large enough to comprise the phased-flares signal (i.e. with amplitudes above the threshold amplitude Athresh) are highlighted in red. Smaller flares are highlighted in light orange. Predicted times when high-amplitude flares will occur are shaded in grey. Out-of-flare variability in the light curve is de-trended with a Savitsky-Golay filter. Some phased-flare targets are stronger detections than others, with A and B as the clearest.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers to this weeks news bulletin. This week we are looking at three papers from the archive, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15104"&gt;TACOS: TESS AM~CVn Outbursts Survey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Marcano et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AM Canum Venaticorum  (AM CVn) stars are a type of cataclysmic variable (CV) in which a white dwarf accretes hydrogen poor material from a compact companion star. In this paper the authors conduct a systematic study of their outbursts, using 9 TESS AV CVn light curves, to place limits on the models. These 9 objects show both super-outbursts and normal outbursts, but the continuous coverage and high cadence of TESS has allowed the authors to place strict limits on the duration and structure of these outbursts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors have found that in some of the systems enhanced mass transfer is needed to explain the observed light curve of the super-outburst and the re-brightening phase. In other systems the color evolution from simultaneous observations in g and r-bands from ZTF, differ from the previously reported color evolution of the longer period AM CVns, where the enhanced mass transfer is responsible for the super-outburst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the previous lack of high cadenced data the authors find that the duration of many AM CVn stars may have been overestimated. New durations have now been calculated for six of the systems investigated. Precursors have also been found to be a common feature of super-outbursts in AM CVns, and five of the six super-outburst have these. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high cadenced 2 and 10 minute TESS data has allowed for the derivation of two new orbital periods, both of which are in good agreement with predictions based on past outbursts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15063"&gt;The unpopular Package: a Data-driven Approach to De-trend TESS Full Frame Image Light Curves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Hattori et al.,  2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TESS mission provides most of its data in the form of full frame images or FFIs. These FFIs contain various systematic effects such as pointing jitter and scattered light from the Earth and Moon. These systematics must be removed from the data before it is used in scientific analysis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors present an open source Python package called "unpopular", which can remove the systematic trends via the casual pixel model method. The code assumes that the shared flux variations across multiple distant pixels are likely to be systematics. The code then removes the trends by modeling the systematics in a given pixel's light curve as a linear combination of light curves from many other distant pixels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overfitting is always an issue in such an analysis, but is prevented here by employing a ridge regression train-and-test framework, where the data points being de-trended are separated from those used to obtain the model coefficients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simultaneous fitting with a polynomial model to capture any long term astrophysical trends is also allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out more about this code and its application to various astrophysical phenomena, please read the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00220"&gt;Detection of photometric variability in the very low-mass binary VHS J1256-1257AB using TESS and Spitzer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Miles-Páez,  2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper looks at VHS J1256-1257AB is an equal mass M7.5 binary system with a late L-dwarf companion - VHS J1256-1257 b, forming one of the few young triple systems of ultra-cool dwarfs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-minute TESS data is used with that from Spitzer to examine the optical and infrared light curves of the system. This examination reveals periodical epochs of quasi-sinusoidal modulation, followed by stochastic variability which resembles the beat pattern created by two waves of similar frequencies that interfere with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying a two wave model to the TESS data, the authors show that the components of VHS J1256-1257AB rotate with periods of 2.0782 hr and 2.1342 hr, values that are supported by the Spitzer observations. The fluxes of VHS J1256-1257A and B  are equal and alternate between states of phase and anti-phase - this explains the observed photometric variability in their combined light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See this paper for more information about this fascinating system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers this weeks news bulletin in which we look at three papers from the archive, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08660"&gt;Discovery of an inflated hot Jupiter around a slightly evolved star TOI-1789&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Khandelwal et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors report on the discovery of a hot Jupiter with an orbital period of  3.2 days, as derived from TESS and ground-based photometry, with radial velocity measurements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The host is TOI-1789, a late F-type metal rich ([Fe/H] =  0.37 dex) star, which has a TESS magnitude of 9.1. The radius of the star is 2.172 R⊙, and it is located 223.56 pc away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By simultaneously fitting the light curves and the radial velocity data of TOI-1789, the authors determined the TOI-1789b planetary mass as 0.70 M&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, with a radius of 1.40 R&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, a bulk density of 0.31 g cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, and an orbital separation of  0.04873 AU. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TOI-1789b is therefore an inflated hot Jupiter, and one of the few nearby evolved stars with a close-in planet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13242"&gt;Searching For Transiting Planets Around Halo Stars. II. Constraining the Occurrence Rate of Hot Jupiters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Boley et al.,  2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is thought that giant or Jovian planets preferentially form around stars with solar or super solar metallicities, and that it is more challenging for them to form within metal poor environments. Hot Jupiters are thought to form via metallicity dependent core accretion, and as such it is even more difficult for them to form in poor metallically environments. 
A more thorough investigation of hot-Jupiters around metal poor stars however, is required to obtain constraints, but this is difficult due to the sample size, and limited quality data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilizing high-cadenced data from TESS, the authors have examined a large sample of halo stars in order to constrain the upper limit of hot Jupiters within the metal poor regime i.e., -2.0 ≤ [Fe/H] ≤ -0.6, allowing the most stringent upper limit to be calculated. The authors find the mean 1-σ upper limit to be 0.18 % for planets with radii 0.8 - 2.0 R&lt;sub&gt;Jupiter&lt;/sub&gt;, and periods of 0.5−10 days. This result is consistent with previous predictions indicating that there exists a certain metallicity below which no planets can form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14538"&gt;Identification of SRGt 062340.2-265715 as a bright, strongly variable, novalike cataclysmic variable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Schwope al.,  2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SRG 062340.2-265715 is an unusual cataclysmic variable (CV) that was observed by TESS in 2020. In this paper the authors conduct a further investigation into the object using ground- and space-based follow up spectroscopy and photometry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optical spectroscopy of the G =12.5 mag counterpart reveals the system to be a nova-like CV at a distance of 495pc. 
Previous observations of the system with TESS indicated an orbital period of 3.941 hrs, this however was not detected in more recent observations. The more recent, higher cadenced TESS data did however, reveal a quasi-periodic oscillation at around 25 min, with ground-based photometry indicating a variability of 32 min. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This object is located in very sparsely populated regions of color-magnitude diagrams for both X-ray and optical colors and magnitudes. It could be an X-ray under-luminous magnetic CV, an intermediate polar, or an over-luminous nonmagnetic CV. The lack of a clear period or spin, prevents final classification.&lt;/p&gt;

The blue dots represent the three transits observed with a TRIUS CCD (TRI) with a precision of 1.16 ppt (∼1.3 mmag), while green dots represent the two transit events observed with an ANDOR CCD (ADR) with a precision of 0.92 ppt (∼1 mmag) in 5-min bins. Lower-left panel: All the transits identified by the CCD detector are phased to the orbital period of TOI-1789b and then binned to 5-min and 20-min cadence are plotted here, with blue and green color depicting the TRI and ADR datasets, respectively. Lower-right panel: Red dots represent the phase folded TESS LC (30-min cadence). Note: In all the panels, the over-plotted black line represents the best-fit transit model from EXOFASTv2, obtained by simultaneous fitting of TESS and PRL photometry data.

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers this weeks news bulletin in which we look at three papers from the archive, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06329"&gt;New eclipsing binaries with mercury-manganese stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Kochukhov et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eclipsing binary systems are rare and useful in that they allow for the precise determination of fundamental stellar parameters. Early-type chemically peculiar stars within these eclipsing binaries are even more important as they enable a better understanding of the origin and evolution of their unusual chemistry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper uses TESS data to examine six eclipsing Mercury-manganese (HgMn) stars.  These are late B-main sequence stars which have an abundance of heavy elements, slow rotation, and low magnetic fields. The authors discuss observations of eclipse variability in these systems, the discovery of which double the known number of eclipsing HgMn stars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The characteristics of each of the six binaries were examined, and the authors confirmed the eclipses in HD 72208 - establishing this object as the longest-period eclipsing HgMn star. Two of the systems, HD 36892 and HD 53004, are eccentric systems showing heartbeat variability in addition to eclipses. HD 53004 has the highest eccentricity amongst all 
 eclipsing HgMn stars known to date, and also has tidally induced oscillations. HD 55776 may also be orbited by a white dwarf. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using TESS data the authors report on the discovery and validation of a double planetary system around a bright,  V-band magnitude 8.85, G dwarf star known as TOI 2319. This host star has a radius of 1.43 R⊙, 1.15 M⊙. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transits for the planets were originally detected by citizen scientists using TESS sector 25 data as part of the Planet Hunters project. When modeling these transits the authors determine a radius of 3.41 R⊕ for the inner planet, and an orbital period of 19.26 - 35 days and a radius of 5.83 R⊕ for the outer planet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radial velocities from HARPS-N and EXPRES allowed a mass estimate for the two planets, with planet b (the inner planet) estimated at 11.56 M⊕, and planet c having an upper mass limit of 27.5  M⊕. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors present the results of a brown dwarf orbiting a M0V star known as TOI-1278. The brown dwarf has a mass of  18.5 M&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;, and was first identified via a percent deep transit in the TESS photometry, which upon further inspection was reveled to be a grazing transit of a Jupiter sized object. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radial velocity data taken by the  SPIRou near-infrared high-resolution velocimeter and spectropolarimeter led to the detection of a Keplerian RV signal with a semi-amplitude of 2306 m/s in phase, with a 14.5-day transit period, and a slight eccentricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers this weeks news bulletin in which we look at three papers from the archive, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01246"&gt;TOI-674b: an oasis in the desert of exo-Neptunes transiting a nearby M dwarf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Murgas et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors examine data from TESS, Spitzer, HARPS, and ground-based facilities, to establish the physical properties of TOI-674b - a planet transiting a 14.2 V-band magnitude M-dwarf star known as TIC 158588995.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors determine that  TOI-674b is a low-density super-Neptune, and that the host star has a M2V spectral type with a mass of 0.42 M⊙, radius of 0.42 R⊙, and  effective temperature of 3514 K. The system itself is approximately 46 pc away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilizing light curve and radial velocity measurements, a circular orbit model was fit through which an orbital period of 1.98 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt; days was calculated, in addition to a planetary radius of 5.25 R⊕, and a mass of 23.6 M⊕. The density of the planet is therefore estimated as 0.91 g cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;.  A non circular orbit fit produced similar results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mass and radius of the planet indicates that it is one of the largest and most massive super-Neptunes around an M-type star known to date.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02610"&gt;Visible-light Phase Curves from the Second Year of the TESS Primary Mission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Wong et al.,  2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using TESS year 2 data, the authors of this paper carried out a systematic study of full-orbit phase curves for known transiting systems in the northern hemisphere. Fifteen transit systems were selected and seven had statistically significant secondary eclipses and day-night atmospheric brightness modulations, these were: HAT-P-7, KELT-1, KELT-9, KELT-16, KELT-20, Kepler-13A, and WASP-12. Two of the seven,  KELT-9b and WASP-12b, have small eastward dayside hotspot offsets. An additional three, KELT-1, Kepler-13A, and WASP-12, have phase-curve variability which can be attributed to the tidal distortion of the host star. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spitzer data were combined with that from TESS to compute the dayside brightness temperatures of the planets, the TESS geometric albedos, Bond albedos, and the phase integrals. Using the new albedo values the trend between the dayside temperature and the geometric albedo for planets with 1500&amp;lt;T&lt;sub&gt;day&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;lt;3000 K, was confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more detailed study was conducted for Kepler-13Ab - please see the paper for more details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03568"&gt;Unveiling the multiple periodicities of the cataclysmic variable LS Cam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Stefanov et al.,  2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LS Cam is an intermediate polar cataclysmic variable (CVs). Some CVs have quasi-periodic changes in brightness with periods slightly shorter or longer than the orbital period - these are called superhumps. Superhumps are thought to be a beat period of 
of the orbital period and the apsidal or nodal motion of the disk,  but the exact cause remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using TESS 120 second cadenced data from sectors 19, 20, and 26, the authors examined LS Cam. Focusing on Sectors 19 and 20, a periodogram analysis was performed, using the Lomb-Scargle method. The resulting power spectrum indicated four significant periodicities, the orbital period of 0.1424 days, a super-orbital variation of 4.053 days, a permanent negative superhump of 0.1375 days, and when looking at Sector 26 a positive superhump of 0.155 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking relations from the literature, the mass ratio and masses of the two components are estimated as 0.24, and 1.26, and 0.30M⊙ respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers this weeks news bulletin in which we look at three papers from the archive, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08614"&gt;TIC 172900988: A Transiting Circumbinary Planet Detected in One Sector of TESS Data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Kostov et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors report on the discovery of a transiting circumbinary planet,TIC 172900988b, detected using TESS Sector 21 data. The planet is part of a binary star system, and was first seen to transit the primary star and then five days later the secondary star. The binary system is also eclipsing with a period of 19.7 days and an eccentricity of 0.45. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilizing data from ASAS-SN, Evryscope, KELT, and SuperWASP, the authors found a prominent apsidal motion of the binary orbit, caused by the dynamical interactions between the binary and the planet. On combining these data with that from TESS the authors derived the mass and radii of the primary star as 1.2377 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt; and 1.3827 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt; respectively, with the mass of the secondary as 1.2021 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt; and its radius as 1.3141 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;. The radius of the planet was calculated as 11.07 R&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;, for the mass and orbital period a range of values were found - 822 &amp;lt; M3 &amp;lt; 981 M&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;, and 188.8, 190.4, 194.0, 199.0, 200.4, or 204.1 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08844"&gt;TKS X: Confirmation of TOI-1444b and a Comparative Analysis of the Ultra-short-period Planets with Hot Neptunes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Dai et al.,  2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using TESS data the authors discovered a super-Earth on a 0.47 day orbit around a Sun-like star, this planet was named TOI-1444b and has a radius of 1.4R⊕. Using radial velocity (RV) measurements from Keck/HIRES the planet was confirmed and its mass derived as 3.87 M⊕. A possible non-transiting planet with a mass of 11.8 M⊕, may also be present in the system and was indicated by the RV measurements. The authors may also have detected a phase curve variation and secondary eclipse of TOI-1444b via the TESS data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Including this object there are only 17 ultra-short period (&amp;lt; 2R⊕; USP) planets with well measured masses and sizes, and as such the authors present a detailed examination of the small sample and compare it to that of sub-day ultra-hot Neptune class (&amp;gt;3R⊕, &amp;gt;2000F⊕  - TOI-849 b, LTT9779 b and K2-100; ). The authors find the following: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USP's have predominantly Earth like compositions with inferred iron core mass fractions of 0.32. Ultra-hot Neptunes have H/He or other volatile envelopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USP's have masses below the threshold of runaway accretion, ultra-hot Neptune's are above. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USP's are found in multi-planet systems with a  secular interaction formation scenario. Ultra-hot Neptune's tend to be "lonely" planets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USP's occur around solar-metallicity stars. Ultra-hot Neptune's tend to have higher metallicity hosts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultra-hot Neptune's are more like hot Jupiters than USP planets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors present the discovery of a high-mass transiting brown dwarf known as NGTS-19b and discovered by the Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS). Using data from TESS (sector 11), the South African Astronomical Observatory, and  the CORALIE spectrograph, the authors derive the characteristics of the system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The host star of the NGTS-19b  system is a K-star, with a mass of 69.5 M&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt; and a radius of 1.034 R&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;, with a period of 17.84 days, and an eccentricity of 0.3767. Given the mass and radius of the brown dwarf the authors estimate the age of the system to be 0.46 Gyrs, but this is not consistent with the age determined from the host star SED, indicating that the brown dwarf might be inflated. Inflation of the brown dwarf however would be difficult and unusual given its mass and the low levels of irradiation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers this weeks news bulletin in which we look at three papers from the archive, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01945"&gt;TESS and HARPS reveal two sub-Neptunes around TOI 1062&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Otegi et al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors report on the discovery of two sub-Neptunes orbiting around a G9V type star which has a V-band magnitude of 10.25. This star is known as TOI 1062 (TIC 299799658) and was observed by TESS in Sectors 1, 13, 27, and 28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precise radial velocity measurements with HARPS reveal that TOI 1062b has a  radius of 2.265 Re, a mass of 11.8 Me, and an orbital period of 4.115050 days. TOI 1062c is not transiting, but a minimum mass of 7.4 Me was determined, in addition to the fact that it is near the 2:1 mean motion resonance with TOI 1062b, with an orbital period of 8.13  days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transiting planet, TOI 1062b, has a mean density of  5.58 g cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; and its internal structure is thought to have a small volatile envelope accounting for 0.35% of the mass at maximum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06480"&gt;8.9-hr Rotation in the Partly Burnt Runaway Stellar Remnant LP 40-365 (GD 492)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Hermes et al.,  2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There exits a class of partly burnt runaway stars, which have been ejected from their binary systems upon a thermonuclear supernova event, LP 40-365 is the prototype of this class. This object is thought to be cause by a subluminous Type Iax supernova that failed to destroy the host star. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors report on an 8.914-hr variability that is evident in both the optical and ultraviolet light curves. The 1% optical variation was first discovered in TESS data, and the 5.8% variation in the UV was detected by the HST. The authors propose that this variation indicates the surface rotation rate and is caused by some sort of inhomogeneity rotating in and out of view, there is no observed Zeeman splitting however and therefore the magnetic field has an upper limit of &amp;lt;20 kG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper goes on to explore how the rotation rate observed could be used to constrain progenitor scenarios, if the angular momentum were mostly conserved. The authors suggest that LP 40-365 was not the donor star of its binary system, but likely the  white dwarf that underwent advanced burning from an underluminous (Type Iax) supernova. See this paper for more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04463"&gt;Eclipsing Systems with Pulsating Components (Types β Cep, δ Sct, γ Dor or Red Giant) in the Era of High-Accuracy Space Data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Lampens et al.,  2021)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eclipsing systems, especially those with a pulsating component, are vital for the understand the properties of stars and stellar systems, and crucial for precise asteroseismology. With the advent of missions like Kepler and TESS, the detection and characterization of such systems has significantly increased. In this paper the authors present recent results from studies of eclipsing systems with pulsating components based on data from Kepler or TESS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systems examined in this paper include: semi-detached eclipsing binaries in (near-)circular orbits; a (near-)circular and non-synchronized eclipsing binary with a chemically peculiar component; eclipsing binaries showing the heartbeat phenomenon; and detached, eccentric double-lined systems. All display one or more pulsating component(s). Please read this paper for more details on the systems presented.&lt;/p&gt;

The TESS full light curve with the 2-minute cadence data is shown in light-grey, and the same data binned to 10 min in dark-grey. The gaps in the data coverage are due to observation interruptions of the TESS spacecraft to send the data to Earth, that occurs after each TESS orbit of 13.7 days. The dots of the LCOGT are bigger for better visualization. The lower panels shows the phase folded TESS light curves for TOI 1062b (left) and TOI 1062c (right) with the 2 min cadence data in light-grey and binned to 10 minutes in black.

It has brought to our attention that a small fraction (&amp;lt;1%) of our TESS objects of interest have duplicate TIC ID's.
This issue was caused by the conversion from one catalog coordinates to another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below we summarize what you the user should expect if you come across one of these duplicates, future analyses at the SPOC level, and how you will be notified of such objects in the data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-issue"&gt;The issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases a star, star A, is resolved into two other stars, stars B and C. Stars A, B, and C all have TIC ID's in TIC 8. 
In this case star A is the sum of stars B and C. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other cases star A is the same as star B,  but both have TIC ID's in TIC 8. See the figure below, for an example of the behavior in this situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img alt="TIC" src="images/TIC.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fig 1.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;PDCSAP flux of TIC 158324245 (blue) which has a duplicated ID of TIC 1717079071 (red).&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past and current analysis at SPOC using TIC 8 assumes that A, B, and C are all valid stars.
TIC 8.x turns star B into a duplicate and replaces the parameters of A with those of B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="future-analyses-at-spoc"&gt;Future analyses at SPOC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Future observations of A by SPOC using TIC 8.x will give the correct answer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Future observations of B by SPOC will be precluded by the POC not including it as a target&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reprocessing of B using TIC 8.x is currently a problem at SPOC, as it is a duplicate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multi-sector analyses of B using TIC 8.x is currently a problem at SPOC, as it is a duplicate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="notification"&gt;Notification&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MAST is currently working on the best way to notify you the user of the problem should you examine data from one of these objects. 
We will update you of the situation as it progresses.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="news"></category></entry><entry><title>TESS Cycle 4 selections</title><link href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/tess-cycle-4-selections.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-05-04T10:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2021-05-04T10:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Rebekah Hounsell</name></author><id>tag:heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov,2021-05-04:/docs/tess/tess-cycle-4-selections.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello and welcome TESS followers to this special news bulletin!

&lt;p&gt;Hello TESS followers and welcome to this weeks news bulletin. This week we have three papers from the archive, enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09865"&gt;Detection of an energetic flare from the M5V secondary star in the Polar MQ Dra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Ramsay et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors study TESS observations of MQ Dra, a highly magnetic cataclysmic variable. The MQ Dra system contains a white dwarf that is accreting material at a low rate from its secondary star (type M5V) via stellar winds. TESS has observed this object in four sectors (16,22,23,24) of Cycle 2, with data indicating a short duration, high energy flare of ~10&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt; erg, with a profile that suggests it is coming from the secondary star. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An energetic flare from a polar is a rare event and there is no evidence that this flare changed the light curve of the system following its occurrence. The authors consider if a coronal mass ejection was associated with the flare. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors go on to compare the frequency of flares from the MQ Dra secondary with M dwarf stars and discuss the overall flare rate of stars with rotation periods shorter than 0.2 days. The authors also discuss how fast rotators can generate magnetic fields with low differential rotation rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09519"&gt;Discovery of an Extremely Short Duration Flare from Proxima Centauri Using Millimeter through FUV Observations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(MacGregor et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the 1st of May 2019 an extreme flaring event from Proxima Centauri was discovered by multiple facilities -  ASKAP, ALMA, HST, TESS, and the du Pont Telescope. The Proxima Cen system is an important one since it is our closest exoplanatary system (1.3pc), and has a potentially Earth-mass planet at an equilibrium temperature of ∼230 K. Proxima Cen is also well established as an M-type flare star, and thus it is a benchmark case for studying the effects of such activity on planetary systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flare event itself was the brightest ever detected in the millimeter and far-UV, brightening by a factor of &amp;gt; 1000 in ALMA and &amp;gt; 14000 in HST. Given that the millimeter and FUV continuum emission trace each-other closely during the flare, it suggests that the millimeter emission could act as a proxy for the FUV for stellar flares. This is an important result as it provides a powerful tool to constrain the high energy radiation environments for exoplanets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the optical the emission is much lower at peak and there is a time-delay. Using TESS data a bolometric energy of 10&lt;sup&gt;31.2&lt;/sup&gt; erg was measured by Vida et. al., (2019). TESS has also observed 71 other flares from Proxima Cen with similar energies (10&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; - 10&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; erg) across 50 days of observations (Howard et. al., 2018). All data indicates that the May flare is common in the optical, but extreme in the millimeter and FUV which in turn suggests that the optical intensity does not necessarily scale to flare energies at other wavelengths and demonstrates the utility of multi-wavelength coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial burst has an extremely short duration, lasting for less than 10 seconds. Taken together with the growing sample of millimeter M dwarf flares, this event suggests that millimeter emission is actually common during stellar flares and often originates from short burst-like events. See this paper for more information in addition to the &lt;a href="https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/news/1680/neighboring-stars-bad-behavior-large-and-frequent-flares/"&gt;NASA news feature&lt;/a&gt; on the system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07627"&gt;V680 Mon -- a young mercury-manganese star in an eclipsing heartbeat system&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Paunzen et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using spectra from the Large Sky AreaMulti-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope, in addition to their own observations, the authors of this paper have identified the primary component of V680 Mon (an eclipsing binary system), as a chemically peculiar (CP) star. Specifically the CP star is of the mercury-manganese (HgMn/CP3) group, with a spectral type kB9 hB8 HeB9 V HgMn. This is a rather homogeneous group which is identified by the presence of strong Hg II and Mn II lines in the optical spectra and occupy the restricted spectral-type range between B6 and A0. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time series data from TESS has also indicated that the system is a "heartbeat star", a rare class of eccentric binary stars with short periods which have a characteristic signature near the time of periastron in the light curves due to the tidal distortion of the components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using all data and ELISa, the authors update the ephemeris and binary system parameters, deriving a  secondary star effective temperature is 8300 K (spectral type A4). This system is relatively rare with V680 Mon being the fifth know eclipsing mercury-manganese CP star, and the first in a "heartbeat" binary. Please see the paper for more information about this system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello TESS followers and welcome to this weeks news bulletin. First we have a "birthday card" for TESS, acknowledging its 3rd year since launch and some of its spectacular detections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Birthday" src="images/Birthday.pdf" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now onto our main feature, this week we have three papers from the archive, enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05653"&gt;Hot planets around cool stars -- two short-period mini-Neptunes transiting the late K-dwarf TOI-1260&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Georgieva et, al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors present the discovery of two sub-Neptune sized planets in a close orbit around the host star, TOI-1260 - a low metallicity K6V dwarf star. Evidence also indicates that there may be an additional planet of a similar size, in a larger orbit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilizing TESS photometry the radii of the two inner planets are derived as, R&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.33 R⊕ and R&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.82 R⊕, with periods of 3.13 and 7.49 days for TOI-1260b and TOI-1260c, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When combining the TESS data with precision radial velocities from HARPS-N, the authors were able to characterize the planetary system, obtaining mass estimates of M&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; = 8.61 M⊕ and M&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;=11.84 M⊕. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The star was determined as moderately active with a complex activity pattern and as such required the use of Gaussian Process (GP) regression for both the light curve detrending and the radial velocity modeling (see the paper for more detail on this method). Using GP the authors successfully disentangled the stellar-induced signal from the planetary signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06448"&gt;Highly structured inner planetary system debris around the intermediate age Sun-like star TYC 8830 410 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Melis et, al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TYC 8830 410 1 is an extremely dusty G9V main sequence star, which hosts inner planetary system dust. This dust has a temperature of ~300 K, a fractional infrared luminosity of ~1%, and a mildy-crystalline sold-state emission feature is shown via mid-infrared spectroscopy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system is ~600 Myrs old and has an M4-type companion star that is 49.5" away and is co-moving and co-distant. A "dipper-like" dimming effect is also exhibited in the system as detected via ASAS-SN, TESS, and LCOGT, this is likely due to a star-sized cloud of dust orbiting the star in addition to smaller dust structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the extreme properties of the material it is likely that dramatic dust production mechanisms were at play, including something similar to a giant impact event like that which formed the Earth-Moon system. Further investigation of this system will deliver significant advances in our understanding of the origin, structure, and evolution of extremely dusty inner planetary systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06944"&gt;TESS observations of TX Col: Rapidly varying accretion flow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Rawat et, al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using data from the TESS mission the authors have examined the intermediate polar TX CoI. A detailed time-resolved timing analysis was conducted, and the power spectra of the 52 day continuous time series indicated an orbital period of  5.691 hr, spin period of 1909.5 s, and beat period of 2105.76 s, consistent with previously obtained results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors also detected the presence of quasi-periodic oscillations for a few days with periods of  5850-5950 s. These QPOs appear to be due to the beating of the Keplerian period with the spin period of the white dwarf. Using the TESS data the authors  examined the evolution of the systems accretion geometry and found that TX Col changes its accretion mechanism each day, thus confirming its variable disk-overflow accretion nature. Please read the paper for more information about this fascinating system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15322"&gt;The first photometric investigation and spectroscopic analysis of two contact binaries: ASAS J124343+1531.7 and LINEAR 2323566&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Xia et, al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors examine data for ASAS J124343+1531.7 and LINEAR 2323566, obtaining key system parameters. The multi-color passband CCD light curves were first obtained  by the 0.84m Ritchey-Chrétien telescope with follow up observations by the WIYN 0.90m Cassegrain telescope, and additional observations obtained by TESS. Taking all data and passing it through the W-D program the authors were able to obtain the mass ratios and fill-out factors for the systems as 3.758, 1.438 and 31.8%, 14.9%, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two systems are both binaries, ASAS J124343+1531.7 is a W-subtype median contact binary, while LINEAR 2323566 is a W-subtype shallow contact binary. The O'Connell effect is indicated in both systems as they have asymmetric light curves. This effect is typically explained by magnetic activity, which was confirmed by the authors when measuring the equivalent widths of the h-alpha lines. The system LINEAR 2323566, was also found to have the strongest magnetic activity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When examining the orbital period changes the authors found that ASAS J124343+1531.7 seems to have a secular period increase, which can be explained by the transfer of mass from a less massive star to a more massive star. In ASAS J124343+1531.7 the two stars are thought to be in the main sequence. For LINEAR 2323566 however,  the more massive star is a main sequence star, while the less massive star has evolved out of the main sequence and is over-luminous and over-sized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.17192"&gt;Exploring the pulsational properties of two ZZ Ceti stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Bognár et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ZZ Ceti star is a type of pulsating white dwarf variable. The luminosity variation is thought to be caused by non-radial gravity wave pulsations within the white dwarf itself. In this paper the authors continue their ground-based observing project with  season long observations of these unique variables using the Konkoly Observatory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targets observed include PM J22299+3024 and LP 119-10, which was also observed by TESS with a 120 second cadence. Using standard Fourier analysis of the data sets (in addition to test data) and asteroseismic fits, the authors derived six possible pulsation modes for PM J22299+3024, and five plus two TESS pulsation frequencies for LP 119-10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The asteroseismic fits of PM J22299+3024 gave an effective temperature of 11,400 K and a stellar mass of 0.46 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;. This temperated is roughly 800 K higher than the values derived by spectroscopy, but the mass has remained the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For LP 119-10 the effective temperature is between 11,800 - 11,900 K, and the stellar mass is 0.7 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;. This temperature is once again higher than that assumed from spectroscopy (11,290 K), and the mass is relatively similar 0.65 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seismic distances of the authors best-fitting model stars agree with the Gaia astrometric distances of PM J22299+3024 and LP 119-10, within errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01970"&gt;Warm Jupiters in TESS Full-Frame Images: A Catalog and Observed Eccentricity Distribution for Year 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Dong et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A warm Jupiter is defined here as a planet that is larger than six Earth radii with an orbital period between 8-200 days. These planets are important as we still don't fully understand how they form, with different origin channels having mean different expectations for a warm Jupiters' properties. Evaluating the overall properties of warm Jupiters'  however is difficult because of the small sample size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors take advantage of TESS year 1 prime mission FFI data, systematically searching for candidates around main sequence host stars that are brighter than 12th magnitude. A catalog of 55 warm Jupiter candidates are introduced, including 19 candidates that were not originally released as TESS Objects of Interest. The authors fit these light curves and then characterize their eccentricities and transit-timing variations (TTVs). After evaluation a list was then created which prioritized those more suitable for ground-based follow-up and via the TESS Extended Mission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors then used hierarchical Bayesian modeling to find the preliminary eccentricity distributions of their warm Jupiter sample using Beta distribution. See the paper for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello TESS followers and welcome to this weeks news bulletin. This week we have three papers from the archive, enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12538"&gt;The TESS Objects of Interest Catalog from the TESS Prime Mission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Guerrero et, al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper presents the 2,241 exoplanet candidates identified by TESS during its primary mission. These objects are all listed within the TESS Object of Interest (TOI) catalog which includes all new planet candidates discovered by TESS and previously-known planets recovered by TESS observations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper discusses the process that is used to identify TOIs and how to investigate the characteristics of the candidate planets found. The paper also discusses some of the more interesting TESS planet discoveries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper goes on to address the large number of small planet candidates around nearby bright stars that are perfect for detailed follow-up observations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13540"&gt;Activity of TRAPPIST-1 analogue stars observed with TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Seli et, al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More and more exoplanets are being discovered around ultracool dwarfs, as such understanding their magnetic activity and so their implication for habitability is of vital importance. Continuous monitoring by a facility such as TESS is required to study these stars for flares and starspots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper goes on to present an analysis of TRAPPIST-1 like ultracool dwarfs using TESS FFI data from the prime mission. The sample consists of 339 stars which are closer than 0.5 mag to TRAPPIST-1 on the Gaia colour-magnitude diagram. Of these data 248 stars were analyzed for flares and rotational modulation caused by starspots, resulting in 94 flare detections. The composite flare frequency distribution shows a power law index similar to TRAPPIST-1, and contains flares up to ETESS=3×10&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; erg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rotational periods shorter than 5 days were also determined for 42 stars, which samples the regime of fast rotators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 88 stars in the sample the ages were estimated using kinematic information and a weak correlation between rotational periods and age was observed - consistent with magnetic breaking. Please read this paper for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12760"&gt;Two Bright M Dwarfs Hosting Ultra-Short-Period Super-Earths with Earth-like Compositions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Hirano et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper presents the observations of two bright M-dwarf stars, TOI-1634 and TOI-1685, which have J-band magnitudes between 9.5 - 9.6, and similar masses, temperatures, and radii. These stars are thought to be ultra-short period (USP) planet candidates, and were identified by TESS, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using both space and ground-based photometry, orbital periods of P = 0.9893457  day and P = 0.6691425 day were determined for TOI-1634 b and TOI-1685 b, respectively. Radial velocity measurements from the IRAD Spectrograph on Subaru were then used to confirm the planetary nature of the objects and the masses measured as 9.94 M⊕ for TOI-1634b and 3.84 M⊕ for TOI-1685 b. The radii of the planets wee determined as Rp=1.773 R⊕  for TOI-1634 b, and 1.463 R⊕ for TOI-1685 b. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining the radii and masses of the planets these USP objects have mean densities consistent with an Earth like internal composition, which is typical for small USP planets. See this fascinating paper for more information, including the discussion of a possible secondary planet in the TOI-1685 system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello TESS followers and welcome to this weeks news bulletin. This week we have three papers from the archive, enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09216"&gt;Temperature and Distance Dependence of Tidal Circularization in Close Binaries: A Catalog of Eclipsing Binaries in the Southern Hemisphere Observed by the TESS Satellite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Justesen et, al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stars in close binary systems can experience tidal forces. Understanding these forces is important as they increase our knowledge regarding  the formation and evolution of close binaries. Modeling tides is however very difficult, and significant uncertainties exist around their strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors investigate tidal circularization in close binaries by using a sample of well characterized TESS southern hemisphere eclipsing systems. By combining light curves and spectral energy distributions, the authors have derived the best-fit orbital and stellar parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TESS data, in combination with data from Kepler and other ground-based facilities, were used to determine the eccentricity distributions of eclipsing binaries over a wide range of stellar temperatures (3000 - 50,000 K) and orbital separations (a/R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = 2-300). A clear dependency between stellar temperatures and orbital separations in the eccentricities of the close binaries was found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors go on to compare their observations with predictions of the equilibrium and dynamical tides. They find that cool binaries tend to agree with the predictions of equilibrium tide, but that warmer binaries i.e., those between 6,250K and 10,000K and which have an orbital separation of ~ 4-10, are found on circular obits and so contradict predictions of dynamical tides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper goes on to suggest that some binaries radiative envelopes may be tidally circularised significantly more efficiently than usually assumed. Please read this fascinating paper for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09725"&gt;GG Carinae: Discovery of orbital phase dependent 1.583-day periodicities in the B[e] supergiant binary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Porter et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GG Carinae is a binary system with an  orbital period of ~31 days, and a B[e] supergiant primary. Using photometry from TESS, ASAS, OMC, and ASAS-SN, in addition to spectroscopy from the Global Jet Watch, the authors investigate the short term variability exhibited by the binary. 
A previously unknown periodicity of 1.583156 days was derived, and present in both the photometry and the radial velocities of the emission lines (He I, Fe II, Si II). The amplitudes of the short period variations in the photometry, and in some of the emission lines, are modulated by the orbital period of the binary. This makes it such that the short-period variations have the largest amplitudes when the binary is at periastron. The authors find that there are no significant changes in the phase of the short period variations over the orbital period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1.583-day variability tends to agree well with the expected period of the 𝑙 = 2 f-mode of the primary given its mass and radius. The authors explain this could be cause by the primary being periodically pulled out of hydrostatic equilibrium by quadrupolar tidal forces when the components are near periastron in the binary’s eccentric orbit (𝑒 = 0.5) and the primary almost fills its Roche lobe. This effect would cause an oscillation at the 𝑙 = 2 f-mode frequency which is damped as the distance between the components increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09746"&gt;TESS re-observes the young multi-planet system TOI-451: refined ephemeris and activity evolution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Barragán et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TOI 451 is a young star that is host to three planets. In this paper the authors present a new analysis of the system using TESS Cycle 3 data. This new analysis of the transits of the three planets has improved the ephemeris of TOI 451 b and TOI 451 c, which will aid in future followup observations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Updated mid-transit times are BJD − 2, 457 000 =1410.9896, 1411.7982 , and 1416.63407 for TOI451 b, c, and d, respectively, and the periods are 1.8587028 , 9.192453 , and 16.364932 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Gaussian Processes the out-of-transit light curve is also modeled with a quasi-periodic kernel. The results of this analysis indicate a change in the properties of the active regions on the surface of the host between Cycles 1 and 3. Please see this paper for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01016"&gt;An ultra-short-period transiting super-Earth orbiting the M3 dwarf TOI-1685&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Bluhm, et al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By studying ultra-short period planets scientists may gain insight into the dynamical histories of planetary systems, as well as the atmospheric evolution of highly irradiated planets. In this paper the authors follow-up a transit signal detected in Sector 19 of the TESS data, which occurs around an M3 V star. The authors confirm the planetary nature of the signal and derive the following planetary parameters: period = 0.6691403 days (using radial velocity measurements from CARMENS spectrograph), mass = 3.78 M&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;, radius = 1.70 R&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;, a bulk density of rho = 4.21 g cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;, and T&lt;sub&gt;equlibrium&lt;/sub&gt; = 1069 K. This planet, TOI-1685 b, is the least dense ultra-short period planet around an M dwarf known to date. The authors also detect another non-transiting planet candidate, TOI-1685 c, which has an orbital period of 9.02 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00925"&gt;BG Ind: the nearest doubly eclipsing, compact hierarchical quadruple system&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Borkovits et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BG Ind is a well known bright binary system which consists of a pair of F stars in a 14.6 day orbit. In this paper the authors use TESS data to discover a second eclipsing binary in the system with a period of 0.53 days. Utilizing a combination of TESS photometry and archival ground-based photometric and radial velocity data, the authors find that the two binaries are gravitationally bound in a 721 day period with a moderately eccentric orbit. A detailed study of several data sets, including TESS, confirms the results of prior studies in which the brighter binary system A, consists of slightly evolved F-type stars with masses of 1.32 M⊙ and 1.43 M⊙, and radii of 1.59 R⊙ and 2.34 R⊙. The newly discovered binary system B, possesses less massive stars of 0.69 M⊙ and 0.64 M⊙, and radii of 0.64 R⊙ and 0.61 R⊙. The authors conclude that the three orbital planes are likely aligned to within 17”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AQ Men is a nova-like variable with a suspected tilted, precessing accretion disc. The geometry of this system can be explored through the examination of grazing eclipses. In this paper the authors have analyzed TESS data of AQ Men, creating some of the best light curves of this system to date. From these data the authors find that the depths of the eclipses change with the orientation of the disc, meaning that these eclipses can be used as a direct test of the tilted accretion disc models. Further analysis indicates that the precession period of the accretion disc varies, as does the shape of the variability. A positive superhump has also been detected that was previously unseen in AQ Men. This positive superhump has a strongly non-sinusoidal shape, which is not expected for a nova-like variable.&lt;/p&gt;

Using TESS full frame images from Sector 1 - 5 the authors have examined 33,054 M-dwarf stars within 100 parsecs. This analysis was conducted with a new pipeline called NEMESIS which was developed to extract de-trended photometry and perform transit searches of single sector data in TESS FFIs. These data can be used to provide an empirical validation of how many planets are missed by using 30 min cadence data. Using this pipeline the authors detect 183 threshold crossing events and 29 planet candidates, 24 of which are new detections. The orbital periods of the sample range from 1.25 - 6.84 days, and radii from 1.26 - 5.31 R&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;. Combining these new detections with the previous detections from Sectors 1 - 5, an integrated occurrence rate of 2.49 planets per star for the period range between 1-9 days, and planet radii between 0.5-11 R&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;, is determined. The authors then go on to project an estimated yield of 122 transit detections of near by M-dwarfs.

Upper panel: Sector 1 light curve of binary A (blue circles), together with the folded, binned, and averaged combined spectro-photodynamical model light curve (red curve). Middle and lower panels: Year 1 (Sector 1) and Year 3 (Sector 27 and 28) light curves of binary B, respectively. The red solution curve exhibits some small extra fluctuations that are probably due to the chromospheric/photospheric activities of the stars. These were modelled mathematically with Fourier-harmonics simultaneously with the two-binary model, while the thin grey curves represent the pure two-binary part of the same solution. The fold of the residuals to the models are also shown below the folded light curves.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We would like to take this opportunity to inform you, the community, of a new High Level Science Product (HLSP) being released at  &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu"&gt;MAST&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/hlsp/tica"&gt;TICA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2515-5172/abd63a"&gt;(Fausnaugh et al. 2020)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TICA provides a calibrated version of TESS full frame images (FFIs). These FFIs are the same products used by the TESS Science Office at MIT to create the &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.stsci.edu/hlsp/qlp&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1614893557574000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw10KvxqkSyHfpCT95L4I8VV"&gt;QLP&lt;/a&gt;-extracted light curves, also provided as an HLSP at MAST.  TICA is able to process a full ~13.7-day orbit of FFIs within ~1 day of the data being downloaded to the ground.  In principle, this allows for “quick-look” calibrated versions of the FFIs for an orbit to be made public to the TESS community up to several weeks earlier than the full ~27-day Sector’s worth of standard mission products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To trial rapid release of TESS data, the calibrated TICA FFIs from the first orbit of Sector 35 will be released early to the community as an HLSP on &lt;strong&gt;Monday, March 8th&lt;/strong&gt;. These data will be made public earlier than the standard mission products, and thus &lt;strong&gt;will be the first release of calibrated pixel data for this Sector&lt;/strong&gt;. The standard mission products for this and all following sectors will still be delivered to the community on the nominal timeline. This activity is being conducted as a “beta” trial, to test a process through which “quick-look” calibrated images could be expeditiously released to the community on an orbit-by-orbit basis, instead of waiting for a full Sector (two orbits) to be completed and processed.  This will allow our TESS community to more rapidly begin analysis, plan follow-up observations, or search for transients and moving targets.  It will also reduce the impact associated with the delay between TESS observations being completed and the data being made public, such as the decay of exoplanet orbital ephemerides or the seasonal availability of telescope time to conduct follow-up in that Sector’s region of the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Will Be Provided As Part Of This Beta Trial?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TICA-calibrated FFIs from the first orbit of Sector 35 will be made available for download from the &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/hlsp/tica"&gt;TICA HLSP&lt;/a&gt; webpage.  The files will be made available to download using &lt;a href="https://curl.se"&gt;curl&lt;/a&gt; scripts, which will allow users to download the full set of FITS images, or select a subset of FITS images to retrieve.  These curl scripts will function in a similar way to those provided as bulk downloads for the mission-produced products.  Many users will find curl already installed on their machines, if not, the software is open source and freely available to install.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contents Of This Beta Trial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The astrometric solutions from the TICA-calibrated images typically differ from those provided by the standard TESS mission products by less than 2 arc seconds. Similarly, the TESS magnitudes of individual objects typically differ by less than 1 millimagnitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only the calibrated TICA FFis will be made available, thus serving as a quick-look version of the data.  The raw data will not be included as part of this activity, and the release does not include light curves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TICA FFis will only be available for download using the bulk scripts on the HLSP page at MAST.  The TICA files will not be available through the MAST Portal, through the MAST API or astroquery.mast, and will not be available for use in TESSCut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are quick-look products, thus the same level of documentation and support will not be available as for the standard mission products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only Sector 35, Orbit 1 will be released as part of this beta trial.  Similar quick-look, single orbit early-releases beyond Sector 35 Orbit 1 will be re-assessed by the mission at a later date, based in part on feedback from the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Will Change With The Standard Sector 35 Release?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing will change in terms of the release of the standard Sector 35 products.  When the full Sector of data is processed, it will be released in its entirety at MAST following the normal process, including being made available through the MAST Portal, the MAST APIs, bulk scripts, and TESSCut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11640"&gt;Mass and density of the transiting hot and rocky super-Earth LHS 1478 b (TOI-1640 b)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Soto et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors present the confirmation and characterization of a super-Earth planet transiting TOI-1640. The host star is an inactive red dwarf with a J-band magnitude of 9.6, a mass of 0.2 M⊙, a radius of 0.25 R⊙, and an effective temperature of 3381 K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using four sectors of TESS data a transit-like feature was detected with a period of 1.949 days. Utilizing 57 radial-velocity (RV) measurements from CARMENES, and 13 RV measurements from IRD, the authors determine that the signal is produced by a planet that has a mass of 2.33 M⊕ and a radius of 1.24R⊕. The bulk density of the planet is 6.66 g cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; which is consistent with a rocky planet with a Fe and MgSiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; dominated composition. See this fascinating paper for more information about the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11295"&gt;GRB 191016A: A Long Gamma-Ray Burst Detected by TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Smith et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only can TESS be used for discovering new exoplanets, it can also be used to detect many types of transients - producing high cadenced light cures of energetic events such as Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such event is GRB 191016A, a long Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) which was detected by Swift-BAT. The peak afterglow of this long GRB was at least 1000 seconds after the BAT trigger, with the brightest TESS data point occurring 2589.7 seconds post trigger. The GRB was not detected by  Fermi-LAT, but was detected by Fermi-GBM without triggering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From ground-based photometry a photometric redshift of 3.29 was derived. Using the high-energy emission and optical peak time derived from TESS data, an estimated Lorentz factor between 90-133 was calculated. The GRB is quite bright and has a peak optical R-band magnitude of 15.1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper focuses on the use of an artificial intelligence (AI) technique that uses machine learning (ML) to find exoplanets in the TESS data. The machine learning methodologies combine several algorithms developed by &lt;a href="https://thetaray.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ThetaRay, Inc&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The technique was initially trained on Kepler exoplanet data, and validated with the confirmed candidates. The technique was then applied to the TESS data, specifically 10,803 light curves of threshold crossing events. From these data the authors find 39 new exoplanet candidates targets.&lt;/p&gt;

This week we present three papers from the archive, enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06066"&gt;TESS Hunt for Young and Maturing Exoplanets (THYME) V: A Sub-Neptune Transiting a Young Star in a Newly Discovered 250 Myr Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Tofflemire et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By studying and characterizing young planetary systems we can gain an insight into the processes which shape them. 
This paper presents the discovery of a sub-Neptune sized planet which orbit the young, late F dwarf type star (M = 1.2 M&lt;sub&gt;sun&lt;/sub&gt;) HD 110082 (TOI-1098). This host star also has a  low-mass, M dwarf binary companion (M = 0.26 M&lt;sub&gt;sun&lt;/sub&gt;), which is separated by ~1’. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The planet was detected via transit events during TESS Cycle 1, and were validated with time-series photometry from Spitzer. Additional confirmation of the planetary nature, and characterization of the host, came from high-contrast imaging and high-resolution optical spectra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HD 110082 is a young star with a rapid rotation, and after further analysis by the authors the star is found to reside in a new young stellar association designated MELANGE-1, with an age of 250(+50/-70) Myr. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilizing both the TESS and Spitzer light curves, the authors measured the orbital period of the planet as 10.18 days with a radius of 3.2 R&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06754"&gt;Precise transit and radial-velocity characterization of a resonant pair: a warm Jupiter TOI-216c and eccentric warm Neptune TOI-216b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Dawson et. al., 20211)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TESS data were used to discover a pair of large, warm, exoplanets around TOI-216. The planets have a 2:1 resonance, and both exhibit timing variations. By 
precisely measuring the mass, radii, orbital properties, and resonant behavior of the planets the authors can test how such planets form in close orbits to their hosts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pervious analysis which used six sectors of TESS data, suffered from a degeneracy between the planet mass and orbital eccentricity. Using radial velocity measurements from HARPS, FEROS, and PFS the authors have now broken this degeneracy. An expanded transit timing variation baseline from TESS and ground-based facilities, have also increased the precision of the mass and eccentricity measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TOI-216c is a warm Jupiter, and TOI-216b is an eccentric warm Neptune. The two planets possess a 2:1 resonance with a moderate libration amplitude of 60 +/- 2 degrees. See the paper for more information about this fascinating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05420"&gt;HATS-34b and HATS-46b: Re-characterisation Using TESS and Gaia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Louden et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A revised characterization of the previously discovered transiting planet systems HATS-34 and HATS-46 is presented. Using TESS data in combination with high-precision parallax and absolute photometry measurements from the ESA Gaia mission, the authors determine more accurate masses and radii of the planets and host stars.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using an isochrone based fit for HATS-34 the authors measure a revised host star mass of 0.952 M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; and radius of 0.9381 R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;. The mass of the planet was then calculated as 0.951 M&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, with a radius of 1.282 R&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For HATS-46 the authors measured a mass of 0.869&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;, and a radius of 0.894 &lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;. For the planet they obtained a mass of 0.158 M&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, and 0.951 R&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors have examined 15 years of photometric data for eight AM CVn systems. These are a rare kind of cataclysmic variable in which a white dwarf accretes hydrogen poor material from a compact donor star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data are collected from the GOTO, ZTF, Pan-STARRS, ASAS-SN and Catalina all-sky surveys and amateur observations collated by the AAVSO. The eight systems have orbital periods from 22.5 - 26.8 days. Using these data the authors find evidence that the AM CVn systems have a similar diversity of long term optical properties as hydrogen accreting dwarf novae. AM CVn systems in the disc instability region are now thought of as a non homogenous group, as the members can exhibit behavior akin to Z Cam systems (long super outbursts and standstills),  SU UMa systems (regular, shorter super outbursts), or even and nova-like systems (only in a high state).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TESS data was used by the authors for the KL Dra system, and its evaluation provided the first ever detection of a normal outburst appearing as a precursor to super outbursts in an AM CVn system. Please read the paper for more information on these fascinating objects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02222"&gt;Two Massive Jupiters in Eccentric Orbits from the TESS Full Frame Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Ikwut-Ukwa et. al., 20211)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery of two short period massive giant planets by TESS are presented in this paper. Each system, TOI-558 and TOI-559, were identified using the 30-minute cadence Full Frame Images. The systems were confirmed via ground-based photometric and spectroscopic follow-up observations from the TFOP working group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TOI-558 b transits an F-dwarf  star with a mass of 1.349 M⊙, a radius of 1.496 R⊙, an effective temperature of 6466 K, an age of 1.79 Gyr. The planet itself has an orbital period of 14.574 days, mass of 3.61 M&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;,  radius of 1.086 R&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;,, and an eccentricity of 0.300.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TOI-559 b transits a G-dwarf star with a mass of 1.026 M⊙, a radius of 1.233 R⊙, an effective temperature of 5925 K, and an age of 1.79 Gyr. The planet has an eccentricity of 0.151, with an orbit of 6.984-days, a mass of 6.01 M&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, and a radius of 1.091 R&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;. The spectroscopic follow-up  of TOI-559 also reveals a long-term radial velocity trend, indicating a long-period companion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eccentricity measured for each system suggests that these planets migrated to their current location through dynamical interactions. The authors then go on to analyzed the known mass distribution of hot Jupiters, but find no significant evidence for multiple populations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00052"&gt;Phase curve and variability analysis of WASP-12b using TESS photometry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Owens et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TESS sector 20 data is examined for the ultra-hot Jupiter, WASP-12b. From the photometric data the phase curve is extracted and planet's atmospheric properties examined. The amplitude of the phase curve is determined as 549 ppm, and a secondary eclipse depth of 609 ppm is found. The peak of the phase curve is also found to be shifted by 0.049 in phase. This shift implies that the brightest spot in the atmosphere is shifted from the substellar point towards the planet's evening terminator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming zero albedo, the eclipse depth infers a day-side brightness temperature of 3128 K. No significant detection of flux from the night-side is found at 60 ppm, implying a night-side brightness temperature of &amp;lt; 2529 K. There is no significant variability in the light from the planet detected over the 27 day sector. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers to this weeks news bulletin!
This week we present three papers from the archive, enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers to this weeks news bulletin!
This week we present three papers from the archive, enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11137"&gt;The Breakthrough Listen Search for Intelligent Life: Searching for Technosignatures in Observations of TESS Targets of Interest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Traas et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exoplanets are key targets for the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI), and missions like TESS have significantly increased the number of planet candidates detected. It is thanks to missions like TESS that we now know that Earth-like planets are common place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors expand upon the Breakthrough Listen (BL) search for extragalactic intelligence by including potential planet hosts identified by TESS. In total 28 targets, with signatures of transiting planets, were selected and 113 30-min cadence data examined. These data were searched for narrowband signals from 1-11 GHz using a modified version of the turboSETI pipeline architecture. Drift rates of +/- 4 Hzs&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; above a minimum signal-to-noise threshold of 10 were then searched for, following the parameters established in Price et al. (2020) and Enriquez et al. (2017).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work conducted in this paper has established some of the deepest limits to date over such a wide band (1-11 GHz), for life beyond Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.12300"&gt;A sub-Neptune and a non-transiting Neptune-mass companion unveiled by ESPRESSO around the bright late-F dwarf HD 5278 (TOI-130)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Sozzetti et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HD 5278 also known as TOI-130, is a nearby, bright, late F-type star with a transiting sub-Neptune planet (TOI-130b) in a 14.3 day orbital period. Utilizing 43 high-resolution spectra from ESPRESSO, in addition to broad-band photometry, the authors derive accurate stellar atmospheric and physical parameters. The TESS light curve in addition to spectroscopic diagnostics are used to determine the impact of stellar activity on the ESPRESSO radial velocities (RVs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a fully Bayesian framework, a joint ESPRESSO RVs + TESS LC analysis was conducted enabling the calculation of system parameters. The newly derived stellar parameters of HD 5278 are T&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; = 6203 K, log g = 4.50 dex, [Fe/H] = −0.12 dex, M&amp;#8902; = 1.126 M⊙ and R&amp;#8902; = 1.194 R⊙. The mass of HD 5278 b was calculated as M&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; = 7.8 M⊕ and R&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.45 R⊕. The derived mean density of the planet is 2.9 gcm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, consistent with a bulk composition with a substantial (∼30%) water mass fraction, and a gas envelope comprising ∼17% of the measured radius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors also discovered a second, non-transiting companion in the system, which has a period 40.87 days and a minimum mass M&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; sin i&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; of 18.4 M⊕. See this fascinating paper for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.12137"&gt;Validation of HD 183579b using archival radial velocities: a warm-neptune orbiting a bright solar analog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Palatnick et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilizing archival radial velocity measurements in addition to TESS observations, the authors of this paper have identified 18 single planet candidate systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 18 systems investigated one exhibits an RV signature that has the correct period and phase matching the transiting planetary candidate, with a false alarm probability of less than 1%! After further analysis the authors validate the object, known as HD 183579b (TOI-1055b), a planet with a radii less than 4 R&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;. This planet is amongst the most accessible small transiting planets for atmospheric characterization. &lt;/p&gt;

The planet was detected by TESS and confirmed with &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/spitzer/main/index.html"&gt;NASA’s Spitzer Space Telescope&lt;/a&gt;. TOI 700d is a small (40% mass of the Sun), cool  (half the surface temperature of the Sun) M dwarf star which is only 100 light years away in the &lt;a href="https://www.iau.org/public/themes/constellations/"&gt;constellation of Dorado&lt;/a&gt;. Three planets are thought to orbit the star: TOI 700 b which is about the size of the Earth and likely rocky with an orbital period of 10 days.  TOI 700 c, a likely gassy planet 2.6 times larger than Earth with an orbital period of 16 days. TOI 700 d, the outermost  planet located in the habitable zone with an orbital period of 37 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May, it was reported that TESS was used to investigate &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2020/nasa-s-tess-enables-breakthrough-study-of-perplexing-stellar-pulsations"&gt;dozens of young, rapidly rotating stars&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Scuti_variable"&gt;Delta Scuti stars&lt;/a&gt;. These stars pulsate in interesting ways, with patterns that are unpredictable and difficult to understand. A team of scientists, led by a professor at the University of Sydney, used TESS data to examine these kinds of stars and found a sub-set with regular pulsation patterns! On finding this trend, the team went on to look for more examples within the Kepler data set and via ground-based observations. The stars found are incredibly important, as their regular patterns have laid the foundation for our understanding of this class of variables, allowing for comparison to models and further exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late June, TESS then helped discover a Neptune sized planet orbiting &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2020/nasa-s-tess-spitzer-missions-discover-a-world-orbiting-a-unique-young-star"&gt;AU Microscopii&lt;/a&gt;, a cool red M dwarf star, located in the Microscopium constellation 31.9 light years away. At only 20-30 million years old, this host star is an infant and subject to producing numerous flares! It is these “temper tantrums” that made detecting the planet particularly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 4th of July marked &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard2020/nasa-s-planet-hunter-completes-its-primary-mission"&gt;the end of TESS’s prime mission&lt;/a&gt;. This was a two year survey that mapped roughly 75% of the sky, found 66 new exoplanets, and 2,100 candidate planets. TESS has now entered into its extended mission, which will last until September 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mid-September brought the discovery of TESS’s &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-missions-spy-first-possible-survivor-planet-hugging-white-dwarf-star"&gt;first possible “survivor” planet&lt;/a&gt; closely orbiting a white dwarf. The planet, WD 1856 b, is similar to the size of Jupiter and orbits its host every 34 hrs. WD 1856 b’s location is unusual as most objects that close are usually torn apart by the white dwarf’s gravitational pull. Scientists are still baffled as to how the planet has survived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in early October, TESS and the &lt;a href="https://evryscope.astro.unc.edu"&gt;UNC-Chapel Hill Evryscope telescope array&lt;/a&gt; simultaneously observed the largest sample of &lt;a href="https://uncnews.unc.edu/2020/10/07/new-research-explores-how-super-flares-affect-planets-habitability/"&gt;super flares&lt;/a&gt; known to date. The data from these observations will help astrobiologists understand how much radiation planets experience during super flares, and thus explore their habitability. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers to this weeks news bulletin!
This week we present three papers from the archive, enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09260"&gt;Six transiting planets and a chain of Laplace resonances in TOI-178&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Leleu et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TOI-178 is an important planetary system with a possible 2:3:3 resonance. Resonant systems are fundamentally important as their fragile orbital configuration implies that there has been no significant scattering or collisional event since early formation, and as such these systems aid us in our understanding of multi-planet formation and evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TOI-178 was first observed by TESS in its second sector, these data have been used in conjunction with data from CHEOPS, ESPRESSO, NGTS, and SPECULOOS in order to obtain a better understanding of the orbital architecture. The work conducted by the authors demonstrates that there are at least six planets in the system, ranging from super-Earths to mini-Neptunes, with radii from 1.152-2.87 R&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;, and periods of 1.91-20.71 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the six planets, five form a 2:4:6:9:12 chain of Laplace resonances, with densities varying from planet to planet. In this paper the authors have gone on to use Bayesian interior structure retrieval models to show that the amount of gas in the planets does not vary in a monotonous way, which is contrary to simple formation and evolution models and other systems known in a chain of Laplace resonances.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08553"&gt;HD344787: a true Polaris analogue?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Ripepi et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classical Cepheids  (DCEP's) are known to be powerful distance indicators, but they can also be used to place constraints on the physics of intermediate-mass stars and pulsation theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors have investigated DCEP HD 344787, which has the fastest positive period change among it class, along  with a quenching amplitude of the light variation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using high resolution spectroscopy for this object in addition to Polaris - another famous DCEP, the authors inferred detailed chemical abundances. These results were then compare to TESS HD 344787 photometry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the TESS data the double mode nature of the HD344787 pulsation is confirmed, with a small amplitude. This work indicates that HD 344787 is on the verge of quenching the pulsation. Spectral analysis also indicates that HD 344787 has not gone through its first dredge up as it shows no depletion of carbon and oxygen and is of an almost solar abundance - this is also true for Polaris. Both HD 344787 and Polaris are thought to be at their first crossing of the instability strip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09227"&gt;Nigraha: Machine-learning based pipeline to identify and evaluate planet candidates from TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Rao et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper presents a new pipeline called Nigraha which uses a combination of transit finding, supervised machine learning, and detailed vetting to identify with high confidence the few planet candidates missed by prior searches and techniques. The pipeline focuses on high signal to noise ratio, shallow transits, that could represent more Earth-like planets. Full details of the pipeline are provided in addition to the supervised machine learning model, and source code. The pipeline has detected 38 planet candidates in the seven sectors investigated, these too will be released to the public. &lt;/p&gt;

The un-binned data is given via the grey points, and data in 30-minute bins are shown as black circles. The best fitting transit model for the system is shown in black. The positions of the transits are marked with lines colored according to the legend. The photometry before and after the mid-sector gap are shown in the top and bottom panels, respectively. The first transit of planet f (thick teal line) occurred precisely between the two transits of the similarly sized planet g (period of 20.71 d - red lines), the three transits were originally thought to have arisen due to a single planet, which was originally designated TOI-178.02 with a period of 10.35 d.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers to this weeks news bulletin!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we would like to thank all those who attended our various TESS events last week at the winter AAS - for those who missed these events but were registered, recordings are online until the end of the month so catch them whilst you can!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week we present three papers from the archive, enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04745"&gt;A hot mini-Neptune in the radius valley orbiting solar analogue HD 110113&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Osborn et al 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using TESS photometric data and HARPS radial velocities the authors have discovered a mini Neptune  (HD 110113b) with a radius of  2.05 R⊕, mass of 4.55 M⊕ , and orbit of 2.5 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The density of the planet is derived as 2.9 gcm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, indicating that the planets is not entirely rock and that it must be a mini-Neptune with a significant volatile atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the planets high incident flux it also occupies the radius valley, but seems to have been able to hold onto a substantial (0.1-1%) H-He atmosphere over its 4 Gyr lifetime. Using a simultaneous gaussian process fit on the multiple activity indicators, the authors were able to fit for the strong stellar rotation signal  getting a period of 20.8 days from the radial velocities and were able to confirm an additional non-transiting planet with a mass of 10.5 M⊕ and a period of 6.7 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04245"&gt;NGTS-13b: A hot 4.8 Jupiter-mass planet transiting a subgiant star&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Grieves et. al, 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NGTS-13b was discovered by the Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS). The host star has a V band magnitude of 12.7 and is likely a sub-giant with a log g&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.04, T&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; = 5819 K, M&lt;sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.30 M⊙, and R&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.79 R⊙.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transiting planet was discovered by NGTS and has a period of 4.12 days, this was then confirmed using TESS (TIC 454069765). Data from TESS, NGTS, and CORALIE were used to determine that the planet has a radius of R&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.142 R&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;, mass of 4.84 M&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;, and eccentricity of 0.086.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some evidence to suggest that planets around 4M&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt; represent a boarder between two separate formation scenarios - core accretion and disk instability. It is thought that massive giant planets may also share similar formation mechanisms to lower-mass brown dwarfs. Given this planets mass, it is an important addition to these studies and may further our understanding of formation mechanisms. See the paper for further findings on this system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03433"&gt;TIC 168789840: A Sextuply-Eclipsing Sextuple Star System&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Powell et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors report the discovery of a sextuply-eclipsing sextuple star system from TESS data (sectors 4 &amp;amp; 5), known as TIC 168789840, or TYC 7037-89-1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first known system of its kind, with three eclipsing binaries. The data for the system was obtained from TESS FFI’s and was also detected within WASP and ASAS-SN surveys. The system contains three gravitationally-bound eclipsing binaries in a hierarchical structure of an inner quadruple system with an outer binary subsystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to calculate additional parameters the system was followed-up by multiple facilities. Using speckle interferometry a 0.42” separation between the inner and outer system was derived, with an outer period of 2 kyr calculated. The fainter of the two components is a 8.217 day eclipsing binary, which orbits the inner quadruple that contains two eclipsing binaries with periods of 1.570 days and 1.306 days. Each binary has been determined to have a similar mass, radii, and effective temperature. For more information about this unusual system please read the paper. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TESSWebinar-small" src="images/TESSWebinar-small.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now onto our featured papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01726"&gt;TESS Delivers Five New Hot Giant Planets Orbiting Bright Stars from the Full Frame Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Rodriguez et. al., 2021)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using photometry from TESS full framed images and followup spectroscopy from TFOP, the authors have discovered and characterized five new hot and warm Jupiters TOI-628 b (TIC 281408474; HD 288842), TOI-640 b (TIC 147977348), TOI-1333 b (TIC 395171208, BD+47 3521A), TOI-1478 b (TIC 409794137), and TOI-1601 b (TIC 139375960).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The five planets are all Jovian in size with radii ranging from 1.01-1.77 R&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, and masses from 0.85 to 6.33 M&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;. The host stars of these systems are bright (9 &amp;lt; V &amp;lt; 10.8, 8.2 &amp;lt; K &amp;lt; 9.3) F and G stars, with temperatures ranging from 5595 ≤ T&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ 6460 K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three of planets orbit sub giant host stars (TOI-640 b, TOI-1333 b, and TOI-1601 b), one of which (TOI-640 b) has an inflated radius and resides in an orbit with a period longer than 5 days. TOI-628 b is the most massive hot Jupiter discovery by TESS to date and has a mass of 6.31 M&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, with an eccentricity of 0.074. Of the five TOI-1478 b has the longest period, 10.18 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13238"&gt;New constraints on the planetary system around the young active star AU Mic. Two transiting warm Neptunes near mean-motion resonance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(E. Martioli et. al., 2020)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors analyze the TESS light curve for AU Mic, a young active star (recently a NASA feature) that is known to host a planet. Using the light curve the  quasi-periodic rotational modulation by star-spots is modeled, simultaneously to the flaring activity and planetary transits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roughly 6.35 flares occur each day, with amplitudes ranging from 0.06% - 1.5% the flux of the star. To obtain the planetary parameters the authors apply a Bayesian MCMC analysis to the five transits of AU Mic. The planet to star ratio is measured as 0.05345, suggesting a physical radius of 4.38 M⊕, and a planet density of 1.1 g cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;. All derived information points to a Neptune-size moderately inflated planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further analysis of TESS data by the team also indicates that there may be two additional transit-like events, and thus a second planet. This second planet is also expected to be a warm Neptune given that the data indicates an orbital period of 18.86 days, a planetary radius of 3.51 R⊕, and an expected mass between 1.7 - 7 M⊕.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11940"&gt;Asteroseismology of SZ Lyn using multi-band high time resolution photometry from ground and space
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Adassuriya et al 2020)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a combination of ground-based photometry (Mt. Abu Infrared Observatory, Fairborn Observatory; archival observations from the WASP project) and TESS data, the authors examine SZ Lyncis - a binary star system in which one of the components is a δ Scuti star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the high cadenced TESS light curve there are 23 frequencies with four independent modes, 13 harmonics were of the main pulsation frequency of 8.297 d&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; or combinations thereof. This  8.297 d&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; was determined as the fundamental radial mode by the amplitude ratio method and using the estimated pulsation constant. Three new frequencies were also discovered at 14.535 d&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, 32.620 d&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, and  4.584 d&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. The first two are non-radial lower p-modes, with the latter a potential indiction of a g-mode in a δ Scuti star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this newly determined information, physical parameters of the system were revised by the authors. A temperature of 7500 K ≤ T&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ 7800 K, a log(g)=3.81, and a mass estimate of  1.7-2.0 M⊙.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome followers to our holiday edition of the TESS  weekly news bulletin. This week we have three papers from the archive. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09709"&gt;TESS observations of Cepheid stars: first light results&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Plachy et. al., 2020)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper aims to understand the limitations of TESS concerning the various subtypes of Cepheids. The authors present the first analysis of Cepheid stars observed by TESS in sectors 1-5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall 25 pulsators were detected: 10 fundamental mode, 3 overtone, 2 double-mode classical Cepheids, 3 Type II, and 7 anomalous Cepheids. Targets were selected from fields with different stellar densities, from the Galactic field and the Magellanic Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 25 objects, three have 2 minute cadenced light curves, the rest were prepared from full frame images using the authors custom FITSH pipeline. From these light curves the authors detect many low amplitude features such as weak modulation, period jitter, and timing variations due to light-time effect. Signs of non-radial modes were also detected, in addition to the first discovery of such a mode in an anomalous Cepheid, the overtone star XZ Cet. The authors confirmed this object with ground-based multicolor photometric measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minimizing the saturation effects in the bright fundamental-mode classical Cepheid β Dor, the authors revealed strong evidence of cycle-to-cycle variations in the star. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09981"&gt;Flare stars in nearby Galactic open clusters based on TESS data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Maryeva et. al., 2020)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper examines flare stars using TESS data. The paper analyzes 957 high cadence light curves of 136 open clusters, finding 56 flare stars. Of the flare stars found, 8 were hot B-A objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all flares detected 63% were detected in a sample of cool stars with T&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 5000 K, 29% in stars of spectral type G, 23% in K-type stars, and 34% of all flares were detected in M-type stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the FLATW'RM (FLAre deTection With Ransac Method) flare finding algorithm, the authors estimated the parameters of the flares and the rotation periods of the stars. Statistical analysis did not reveal any direct correlation between ages, rotation periods and flaring activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11395"&gt;Tidally Excited Modes and δ Scuti Pulsations in the Eclipsing Triple Star IM Persei&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Lee et. al., 2020)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TESS data was used to investigate the triple star system - IM Per. This is a system whose eclipsing pair masses and radii are known to within 1 %. The TESS light curve was found to exhibit partial eclipses and multiple oscillations with milli-mag-level amplitudes, these oscillations affect eclipse timing measurements. Using TESS data and binary modeling, the authors indicate that the eclipsing components of the triple system are twin dwarfs with parameters of M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; / M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.995, R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; / R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.901, and Δ (T&lt;sub&gt;eff,1&lt;/sub&gt; - T&lt;sub&gt;eff,2&lt;/sub&gt;) = 12 K in an eccentric (e = 0.049), detached configuration. The third light of
l&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.054 comes mostly from a G-type tertiary companion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the paper the authors predict a parallax of 1.52 mas, which concurs with the Gaia measurement. For additional information about the pulsation periods and multi-frequency analysis, check out the paper online!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers to our weekly news bulletin. This week we have kind of a big one to make up for our absence last week. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.01173"&gt;TESSVisibility -- When was my favorite star or asteroid observed by TESS?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Pál, 2020)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper demonstrates a new tool called &lt;em&gt;tessvisibility&lt;/em&gt;. Utilizing this tool the user can easily retrieve the current and/or predicted visibility of a bulk amount of objects in the TESS field of view. The tool considers both stationary and moving Solar System targets like asteroids or comets. The code itself is highly portable, and accurately includes the gaps between the focal plane CCDs, and the gaps between the cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02211"&gt;Decaying Orbit of the Hot Jupiter WASP-12b: Confirmation with TESS Observations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Turner et. al., 2020)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The orbits of some giant planets close to their host stars can decay due to tidal interactions. To date only one hot Jupiter system has been found to do this, WASP-12b. This orbit decays at a rate of 29 msec per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of this paper used TESS data to verify that the orbit of WASP-12b is indeed changing. They found that transit and occultation are consistent with a decaying orbit with an updated period of 1.091 days, and a decay rate of 32.53 msec per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The orbital decay timescale was found to be 2.90 Myr, and that if the observed decay were due to tidal dissipation then the modified tidal quality factor is 1.39 x 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;. This tidal quality factor is at the lower end of the values currently derived for binary star systems and hot Jupiters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13795"&gt;The GAPS Programme at TNG XXVIII -- A pair of hot-Neptunes orbiting the young star TOI-942&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Carleo et. al., 2020)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young stars and multi-planet systems allow scientists to understand and constrain planetary formation and evolution theories. In this paper the authors validate the nature of two Neptune like planets transiting TOI-942.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TOI-942 is a young 50 Myr star observed in TESS sector 5. By modeling the TESS light curve and utilizing  radial-velocity measurements, the authors confirm the planetary nature of the candidate in addition to detecting another transiting planet in a larger orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through detailed analysis of photometric and spectroscopic data the authors determine planet and stellar parameters for the system. TOI-942 is a K2.5V star with rotation period of 3.39 days, a projected rotation velocity of 13.8 km/s and a radius of ~0.9 Rsun. The inner planet, TOI-942b, has an orbital period of 4.3263 days, a radius of 4.242 R⊕, and a mass upper limit of 16 M⊕. The outer planet, TOI-942c, has an orbital period of 10.1605 days, a radius of 4.793 R⊕, and a mass upper limit of 37 M⊕.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11733"&gt;HD 63021: Chromospheric Activity and Mass Transfer in a Close Binary Whelan et al 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Whelan et. al., 2020)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors investigate the A-type star HD 63021 and find that it is a double-lined spectroscopic binary with highly variable emission associated with the primary star. From multi-epoch spectroscopy an orbital period of 2.9 days is determined, along with a mass ratio M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; / M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.23.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slowly rotating A1 V star has a rotational speed of ∼34 km/s. The mass of the primary is assumed as 2.3 M⊙, with the mass of the secondary being ∼0.5 M⊙.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secondary is thought to be an evolved star which almost fills its Roche lobe. The rotation of the secondary is more rapid than the primary at ∼44 km/s, there is also evidence that it is chromospherically active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TESS light curves indicate that there are two strong periods, one matches that of the orbital period and the other is at half the orbital period. The authors findings suggest that HD 63021 is a close binary system undergoing unsteady mass transfer from the secondary star to the primary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11821"&gt;A precise asteroseismic age and metallicity for HD 139614: a pre-main-sequence star with a protoplanetary disc in Upper-Centaurus Lupus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Murphy et. al., 2020)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The star known as HD 139614 is a 14Myr old, possibly pre-main sequence star found in the Sco-Cen OB association in the Upper Centaurus-Lupus subgroup. The system has a slightly warped circumstellar disc with ring structures, hinting at the possibility of planets. The star is thought to be metal deficient except for volatile elements, which makes it a λ Boo class star meaning that it may have recently accreted gas-rich dust poor material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the TESS light curve and an échelle diagram authors identify seven dipole and four radial pulsation modes among the stars δ Sct pulsations. Using the MESA stellar evolution and GYRE stellar oscillation programs for modeling the authors confirm that HD 139614 is on the pre-main sequence. Further analysis indicates that the star has an age of 10.75 Myrs, a mass of 1.52 M⊙, and a global metal abundance of Z=0.0100. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers to our weekly news bulletin. This week we have one important notification in addition to three papers from the archive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First the notification,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At stated above the TESS Cycle 4 submission process for proposals is now live, with submission hosted at the &lt;a href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/ark/rps/"&gt;NASA ARK/RPS page&lt;/a&gt;. There are several additions to the page which include options to submit new Mini proposals and joint TESS/Fermi programs. Note that Cycle 4 is  also the first TESS proposal cycle to be dual anonymous. For more information please check out our &lt;a href="proposing-investigations.html"&gt;guest investigator proposal page&lt;/a&gt; in addition to the submission page. You can also find useful Cycle 4 proposal templates &lt;a href="proposal-templates.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now on to our featured papers,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06493"&gt;The dual nature of blazar fast variability. Space and ground observations of S5 0716+714&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Raiteri et. al., 2020)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blazar S5 0716+714 is a short period variable, showing variability on timescales of less than a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors use 2-min TESS data (from December 2019 to January 2020) to analyze the objects fast variability, with additional data from the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope Collaboration ( B, V , R, and I bands), and Swift (UV and X-ray). The combined data sets allowed the authors to study the spectral variability of the object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a new method of analysis the authors unveil the shortest optical variability. They found that below 3 days there are significant characteristic variability time-scales of about 1.7, 0.5, and 0.2 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Variations less than 0.2 days are strongly chromatic, and are thought to be due to intrinsic energetic processes involving emitting regions such as jet sub-structures with dimensions less than a milliparsec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flux changes on time-scales greater than 0.5 days are quasi-achromatic, and are likely due to Doppler factor changes of geometric origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08214"&gt;Tidally perturbed pulsations in the pre-main sequence δ Scuti binary RS Cha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Steindl et. al., 2020)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When stars exist in binary systems tidal forces can influence asteroseismic properties. This effect has been noted in several systems via tidally perturbed pulsations, but non of which contained pre-main sequence stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors investigate RS Cha, a system which contains two δ Scuti stars which appear to have pulsations that are influenced by tidal effects. This is the first system of its kind to be observed with this effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking TESS data  the authors have performed binary modeling using PHOEBE to interpret the binary light curve and allow the investigation of the pulsations of both components in RS Cha. From their analysis the authors find evidence for tidally perturbed modes, which enabled the identification of pulsation modes. The system is found to exhibit mainly dipole modes in addition to one prominent l=2 or l=3 mode. See the paper for more information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08685"&gt;Asteroseismology of the heartbeat star KIC 5006817&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Merc et. al., 2020)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kepler and TESS data are used together with &lt;em&gt;Lightkurve&lt;/em&gt; to conduct a global asteroseismic analysis of KIC 5006817 and quantify its stellar properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis confirmed the classification as a heartbeat binary. The rich oscillation spectrum of  KIC 5006817 facilitate estimating power excess at 145.50 μHz, and large frequency separation as 11.63 μHz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary component is a low-luminosity, red-giant branch star with a mass, radius, surface gravity, and luminosity of 1.53 M⊙, 5.91 R⊙, 3.08 dex, and 19.66 L⊙, respectively. The orbital period of the system is 94.83 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work presented is based on that conducted at the ERASMUS+ GATE 2020 Summer school on space satellite data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers to our weekly news bulletin. This week we have four papers from the archive, two of which highlighting a new data product available on &lt;a href="https://mast.stsci.edu/portal/Mashup/Clients/Mast/Portal.html"&gt;MAST&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers to our weekly news bulletin. This week we have four papers from the archive, two of which highlighting a new data product available on &lt;a href="https://mast.stsci.edu/portal/Mashup/Clients/Mast/Portal.html"&gt;MAST&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03465"&gt;A search for variable subdwarf B stars in TESS Full Frame Images -- I. Variable objects in the southern ecliptic hemisphere&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Sahoo et. al., 2020)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using TESS Full Frame Images, the authors search for pulsating subdwarf B stars observed in the first year of the primary mission. These observations cover most of the southern ecliptic hemisphere and are of a 30 minute cadence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within their search the authors find only two pulsating subdwarf B stars, but as a byproduct of their work they detect 1807 variable objects. Of these objects most are unclassified but 26 are variables with known sdB spectra, 83 are non-classified pulsating stars, an additional 83 are eclipsing binaries (detached and semi-detached), a mix of 1535 pulsators and non-eclipsing binaries, two novae, and 77 variables with known (non-sdB) spectral classification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the eclipsing binary sample two known HW Vir systems were found in addition to four new candidates. The two sdB pulsators investigated were not rich in modes, but estimates of the modal degree for one of them were derived. The authors select five sdB candidates from the 83 pulsators, for mode identification. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors explore how to avoid the number of period aliases for transiting TESS systems which have two transits separated by a period on the order of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis was conducted using simulated TESS primary and extended mission data, in addition to simulated data for NGTS photometry and HARPS+CORALIE spectroscopy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors determined that TESS will find ~400 exoplanets with one transit in each of the primary and extended missions. Given the TESS temporal coverage, each of the systems will have roughly 38 period aliases. Utilizing the additional photometric and spectroscopic resources simulated for NGTS and CORALIE, it was determined that the true aliases could be found and the period obtained if there were an observation campaign with these facilities that spanned 50 days. The number of systems whoes periods could be accurately determined increase to 207 if additional observing campaigns are employed using HARPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.16273"&gt;Keeping up with the cool stars: One TESS year in the life of AB Doradus
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Ioannidis et. al., 2020)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors use TESS to study the photospheric activity of the rapid rotator AB Doradus. TESS has observed almost 600 rotations of this star with a high cadence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using TESS data the authors have studied star spots, flares, and determined that the peak-to-peak variation of the rotational modulations reaches almost 11 %. The starspots on AB Doradus were also shown to prefer longitudinal positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors went on to measure the positions of the active regions on AB Doradus, using spot modeling. They found the the preferred spot configurations should include large regions extending from low to high stellar latitudes. The movement of the spots is therefore thought to be the result of both differential rotation and spot evolution. The average spot lifetime was determined as roughly 10  - 20 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15905"&gt;TOI 122b and TOI 237b, two small warm planets orbiting inactive M dwarfs, found by TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Waalkes et. al., 2020)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery of two warm planets, TOI 122b and TOI 237b, is presented in this paper. These planets transit inactive M dwarfs, and were found using TESS data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TOI 122b is at a distance of 62pc, has a radius of 2.72 R&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;, an orbital period of 5.08 days, and receives 8.8 times the Earth's bolometric insolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TOI 237b is at a distance of 38 pc, has a radius of 1.44 R&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;, an orbital period of 5.43 days, and receives 3.7 times the Earth's bolometric insolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the amount of bolometric insolation, these two planets can be considered as some of the coolest planets discovered by TESS. The planets span the small-planet radius valley and are useful for exploring volatile evolution around M dwarfs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01666"&gt;V772 Cas: an ellipsoidal HgMn star in an eclipsing binary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Kochukhov et. al., 2020)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V772 Cas was thought to be a rare type of magnetic chemically peculiar late B-type star, in an eclipsing binary system. TESS has observed this system and found a clear eclipse with a period of 5.0137 days, accompanied by a significant out-of-eclipse variation of the same period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilizing high-resolution spectroscopy V772 Cas was determined to be an SB1 system, in which its primary star is rotating a factor of two slower than the orbital period, and has chemical peculiarities consistent with a non-magnetic HgMn peculiar star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eclipsing HgMn stars are rare, and this one of only three objects known to date. Given its brightness, V772 Cas is a great candidate for detailed followup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using both photometry and spectroscopy the authors have performed detailed modeling of the system with the PHOEBE code. From this analysis fundamental parameters were derived and the out-of-eclipse brightness variation can be explained by the ellipsoidal shape of the evolved, asynchronously rotating primary. This variability is the first of its kind in a HgMn star. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers to a special Halloween edition of the TESS news bulletin! This week we have three papers from the archive in addition to a new spooky feature!.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Halloween this week NASA has released its latest &lt;a href="https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/alien-worlds/galaxy-of-horrors/"&gt;Galaxy of Horrors posters&lt;/a&gt;. The new posters feature a galaxy that has stopped producing stars and become a cosmic &lt;a href="https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/resources/2246/galactic-graveyard/"&gt;graveyard&lt;/a&gt;, an explosive &lt;a href="https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/resources/2250/gamma-ray-ghouls/"&gt;gamma-ray burst&lt;/a&gt; caused when the cores of two dead stars collied and merge, and a &lt;a href="https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/resources/2248/dark-matter/"&gt;dark matter&lt;/a&gt; poster. These posters were produced by NASA's Exoplanet Explorer Program office at JPL, and are free to download &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/new-nasa-posters-feature-cosmic-frights-for-halloween"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, so spook up your homes this weekend with some mysterious astronomical phenomena!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now onto our featured papers for the week,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11977"&gt;Search for planets in hot Jupiter systems with multi-sector TESS photometry. I. No companions in planetary systems KELT-18, KELT-23, KELT-24, Qatar-8, WASP-62, WASP-100, WASP-119, and WASP-126&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Maciejewski et. al., 2020)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giant planets in close orbits to their host stars are often referred to as hot Jupiters. There are many questions regarding the formation of these planets. In this paper the authors have used multi-sector photometry from TESS to search for additional planes in the KELT-18, KELT-23, KELT-24, Qatar-8, WASP-62, WASP-100, WASP-119, and WASP-126 planetary systems. Planets are hunted for using both the transit technique and transit timing method. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the KELT-23 and WASP-62 systems planets down to terrestrial-size have been eliminated. In the remaining systems planets down to mini-Neptunes or Neptunes have been eliminated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the transit timing analysis no sign of long-term trends or periodic perturbations have been found for all studied hot Jupiters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suggested isolation of these hot Jupiters indicates that a highly-eccentric migration mechanism was probably responsible for bringing them into their tight observed orbits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14436"&gt;TOI-954 b and EPIC 246193072 b: Short-Period Saturn-Mass Planets that Test Whether Irradiation Leads to Inflation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Sha et. al., 2020)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors present the discovery of two short period Saturn mass planets. The first transits TOI-954, a G  sub-giant with a V-band mag of 10.34, observed in TESS Sectors 4 and 5. The second planet transits a G dwarf called EPIC 246193072, which has a V-band magnitude of 12.70 and was observed in K2 campaigns 12 and 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using ground-based and archival follow-up observations the authors have characterized these two planets. TOI-954 b has a radius of 0.852 R&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, a mass of 0.174 M&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, and an orbital period of 3.68 days.  EPIC 246193072 b has a radius of 0.774 R&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;,  a mass of 0.260 M&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, and has an orbital period of 12.46 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As TOI-954 b is 30 times more irradiated than EPIC 246193072 b, but is of a similar size, it allows the community an opportunity to test whether irradiation leads to inflation of Saturn-mass planets. These two systems allow the comparison of Saturn-mass planets at different stages of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13791"&gt;Exploring Trans-Neptunian Space with TESS: A Targeted Shift-Stacking Search for Planet Nine and Distant TNOs in the Galactic Plane&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Rice et. al., 2020)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of this paper have created a new pipeline that is designed to search faint data for undiscovered solar system bodies using TESS full frame images. The baseline flux of each pixel is removed before the alignment and co-adding of all frames along plausible orbital paths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code has been tested by the authors on three trans-neptune objects: 90377 Sedna (V=20.64), 2015 BP519 (V=21.81), and 2007 TG422 (V=22.32), with signals recovered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors then went on to do a blind search of sectors 18 and 19 to further test their pipeline. They searched for dim objects at geocentric distances of 70−800 au in a targeted search for Planet Nine, and any previously unknown detached Kuiper belt objects that may shed light on the Planet Nine hypothesis. They found that they were able to recover the signals of distant solar system bodies in the galactic plane with a V-band magnitude brighter than 21st, and at distances less than 150 au. &lt;/p&gt;

Proposals will be due at 4.30pm on January 22, 2021. Cycle 4 observations begin in June 2021 and end in September 2022, covering observing sectors 40-56. Observations in Cycle 4 will cover the Northern Ecliptic Hemisphere and the Ecliptic Plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cycle 4 solicitation can be found on &lt;a href="https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary!init.do?solId={4B9CAAB3-D398-183A-B1F3-EF963DF415C7}&amp;amp;path=open"&gt;NSPIRES&lt;/a&gt;. Cycle 4 is longer than a typical cycle and lasting approximately 15 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cycle 4 will have a dual-anonymous peer review. Under this system the reviewers do not have knowledge of the proposal teams while they perform their scientific evaluation of the proposal. Proposers should consult the &lt;a href="https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/viewrepositorydocument/cmdocumentid=736703/solicitationId=%7B4B9CAAB3-D398-183A-B1F3-EF963DF415C7%7D/viewSolicitationDocument=1/Guidelines%20for%20Anonymous%20Proposals%20DAPR%20Doc%20Astro%20GO%20Programs.pdf"&gt;Guidelines for Anonymous Proposals document&lt;/a&gt; on the NSPIRES of this program element for instructions on writing proposals appropriate for dual-anonymous peer review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three categories of TESS GI proposals for Cycle 4; investigators are free to select the category that best reflects their scope of their proposed work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mini proposals - This is a new proposal category. These programs require minimal resources, up to 50 20-second cadence targets and 1,000 2-minute cadence targets. Proposals in this category are not eligible for funding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small proposals - Proposals of limited scope.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large proposals - Proposals of wide-ranging scope and science yield. Large proposals must deliver a clear benefit for the broader scientific community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with Cycle 3, can request 20-second cadence targets, 2-min targets, and funding to support analysis of TESS data, include full-frame images. Additionally, proposals that support the acquisition and analysis of scientific data from ground-based telescopes are solicited. Ground-based observing focused proposals may support the analysis and/or interpretation of TESS scientific data collected in Cycle 4 or TESS data already collected in Cycles 1-3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TESS GI program can also award Swift observations through a joint program with the Swift mission. Up to 100 ks Swift time will be available through this program. Small programs are eligible for up to $70,000 and large programs for up to $250,000.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="news"></category></entry><entry><title>TESS Weekly Bulletin: October 23rd</title><link href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/tess-weekly-bulletin-october-23rd.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-10-23T10:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-10-23T10:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Rebekah Hounsell</name></author><id>tag:heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov,2020-10-23:/docs/tess/tess-weekly-bulletin-october-23rd.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello TESS followers and welcome to this weeks news bulletin!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07323"&gt;Robust asteroseismic properties of the bright planet host HD 38529&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Ball et. al., 2020)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wide-field, high cadenced observations provided by TESS makes it perfect to detect and study the oscillations of interesting stars, particularly planet hosts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors have detected solar-like oscillations in the bright G5 sub-giant HD 38529. This star hosts an inner Jupiter mass planet which has an orbit of 14.3 days, and an outer orbit low-mass brown dwarf which has a period of 2136 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the results from multiple stellar modeling teams the authors produce asteroseismic estimates of the stars properties, including its mass which they derive as M=1.48⊙, radius R=2.68 R⊙ and age t=3.07 Gyr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06928"&gt;Planetary system LHS 1140 revisited with ESPRESSO and TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Lillo-Box et. al., 2020)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The M-dwarf LHS 1140 hosts two known transiting planets with orbital periods of 3.77 and 24.7 days respectively. These planets were detected with HARPS and Spitzer. The external planet is known as LHS 1140 b and is a rocky super-Earth that is located in the habitable zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors use high-precision radial velocity measurements from ESPRESSO, in addition to data from HARPS and TESS to provide additional information about the system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New masses were determined for both planets. LHS 1140 b is estimated to have a mass of 6.48 M⊕ and LHS 1140 c is estimated as 1.78  M⊕. Both planets are thought to have Earth-like bulk compositions, but internal structure analysis suggests that LHS 1140 b might be iron-enriched. When studying the water content of the planets a maximum mass fraction of 10-12% was derived, equivalent to a deep ocean layer of 779 km for LHS 1140 b. Evidence for a new planet candidate in the system of mass 4.8 M⊕, with an orbital period pf 78.9 days has been detected by the authors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09766"&gt;Which Stars can see Earth as a Transiting Exoplanet?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Kaltenegger et. al., 2020)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planets are often found via the transit and eclipse of their host stars. Spectroscopic observations of these events are commonly used to characterized the planets atmosphere. To detect and obtain useful information however, the exoplanets orbit must be aligned with our line of sight. This paper asks the question what stars closest to us would be able to search for life on Earth in the same way that we search for life. Using data from the TESS Input Catalogue and Gaia DR2 the authors identify 1,004 Main Sequence stars within 100 parsecs, of which 508 guarantee a minimum 10-hour long observation of Earth's transit. The list consists of about 77% M-type, 12% K-type, 6% G-type, 4% F-type stars, and 1% A-type stars close to the ecliptic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00604"&gt;EvryFlare III: Temperature Evolution and Habitability Impacts of Dozens of Superflares Observed Simultaneously by Evryscope and TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Howard et. al., 2020)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is thought that superflares may provide the dominant source of biological relevant UV radiation for rocky M-dwarf planets (M-Earths) in the habitable zone. These flares could alter the planets atmosphere and potentially make them more favorable for life. A 9000 K black body has typically been used to approximate the combined line and continuum flare emission.  If the superflares are hotter than 9000 K, then the UV emission could be 10 times brighter than current predictions from the optical. It is not known however, how long M-dwarf superflares are above this temperature. To date only a few M-dwarf super flares have been recoded with multi-wavelength high-cadenced observations. This paper doubles the number of events via the use of both TESS and Evryscope data. Measurements from these two facilities, taken simultaneously, has allowed the authors to conduct the first systematic exploration of the temperature evolution of M-dwarf superflares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The temperatures of 42 superflares from 27 K5-M5 dwarfs are measures using 2 min cadenced data. The authors find that superflare peak temperatures increase with flare energy and impulse, with the time above 14,000K being dependent upon the energy. Of the flares investigated 43% emit above 14,000 K, 23% emit above 20,000 K and 5% emit above 30,000 K. The hottest flare studied by the authors reached  42,000 K. It is  estimated that M-Earths orbiting &amp;lt;200 Myr stars typically receive a top-of-atmosphere UV-C flux of ~120 W m^-2 and up to 10^3 W m^-2, 100-1000X the time-averaged XUV flux from Proxima Cen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fig 1.  Taken from Howard et. al., 2020. 2 min data for the flare events observed with both  Evryscope (blue) and TESS (red). Flare fits are shown as grey lines. UT identifiers are approximated from barycentric TESS epochs and may differ by up to 10 min from the exact flare peak time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14202"&gt;Stellar Spins in the Open Cluster NGC 2516&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Healy et. al., 2020)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By measuring the distribution of stellar spin axis orientation in a group of stars with the same age, you can probe the process of star formation. 
In this paper the authors use TESS photometry, ground based spectroscopy (Gaia-ESO and GALAH surveys), broad-band stellar magnitudes, and Gaia astrometry to measure stellar inclinations for 33  objects in the open cluster NGC 2516, they therefore try to quantify the overall cluster rotation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measurements obtained suggest that stellar spins in the cluster are isotropically orientated, but still allowing for the possibility that they are moderately aligned. With an isotropic distribution it would suggest a star-forming environment in which turbulence dominate ordered motion. A moderately aligned distribution means a more substantial contribution from rotation. A 3-D analysis of the clusters internal kinematics also suggests no significant signatures of overall rotation. Within this work the authors also identify evidence of cluster contraction, suggesting possible ongoing mass segregation in NGC 2516.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13623"&gt;TOI 540 b: A Planet Smaller than Earth Orbiting a Nearby Rapidly Rotating Low-mass Star&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Ment et. al., 2020)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors present the discovery of TOI 540 b, a hot planet orbiting the low-mass star 2MASS J05051443-4756154. The planet has an orbital period P=1.239149 days and a radius of r=0.903±0.052 R&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;. Given its mass and radius it is likely a terrestrial planet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system is 14.008 pc away with the host star mass and radius estimated as M=0.159 M&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt; and R=0.1895 R&lt;sub&gt;Sun&lt;/sub&gt;. The star has a very short rotational period of P&lt;sub&gt;rot&lt;/sub&gt; =17.4264 hours and correspondingly small Rossby number of 0.007. Using XMM-Newton observations the host star is also seen to have a high X-ray-to-bolometric luminosity ratio of L&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;/L&lt;sub&gt;bol&lt;/sub&gt; =0.0028, which is consistent with the X-ray emission being observed at a maximum value of L&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;/L&lt;sub&gt;bol&lt;/sub&gt; ≃ 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; as predicted for the most rapidly rotating M dwarfs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery of TOI 540 b is based on precise photometric data from TESS and ground-based follow-up observations by the MEarth team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello TESS followers and welcome to our weekly news bulletin! This week we have three papers from the archive in addition to two exciting notices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the notices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TESS GI office is running a special session at this &lt;a href="https://aas.org/meetings/aas237"&gt;winters AAS&lt;/a&gt;. The session is entitled “Mining TESS Data with Machine Learning and Other Advanced Methods”.  If you would like to give a talk within this session please submit your abstract to AAS by Oct 6th!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you like to be involved in removing planet imposters? Automated methods of processing data from the TESS planet-finding mission sometimes fail to catch imposters that look like exoplanets. The human eye, however, is extremely good at spotting these troublemakers. So we’re asking you to lend NASA a hand. No prior interplanetary law enforcement experience is necessary. If you would like to take part in this please see the &lt;a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/marckuchner/planet-patrol?utm_source=Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=announce29sep2020"&gt;Planet Patrol&lt;/a&gt; citizen science project which is live at exoplanetpatrol.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, onto the papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13515"&gt;TOI-811b and TOI-852b: New transiting brown dwarfs with similar masses and very different radii and ages from the TESS mission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Carmichael et. al., 2020)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors present the discovery of two transiting brown dwarfs, TOI-811b and TOI-852b using TESS data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TOI-811b has a mass M&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; = 55.3 M&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, radius of R&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.35 R&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, and orbit of P = 25.16551. The age of this system is 93 Myr, this is why the brown dwarf has a larger radius and in a longer orbit, which is unusual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TOI-852b has a mass  M&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; = 53.7M&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, radius of R&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.75 R&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, and orbit of P = 4.9456.The TOI-852b system is 4.0 Gyrs old, and is similar to other older brown dwarf transiting systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The host stars of both these systems are 1.32 M⊙, but differ in their radii, effective temperatures, and metallicities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13496"&gt;Analysis of eclipsing binaries in multiple stellar systems: the case of V1200 Centauri&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Marcadon et. al., 2020)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of this paper have used TESS data in combination with that from other facilities to investigate V1200 Centauri. Data was collected from TESS, the Solaris network, and the CHIRON spectrograph for radial velocities (plus additional data published in  the literature).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the combined data set, the authors have determined that V1200 Cen consists of a 2.5-day eclipsing binary orbited by a third body. The properties of the primary were derived as M&lt;sub&gt;Aa&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.393 M⊙, R&lt;sub&gt;Aa&lt;/sub&gt;=1.407 R⊙ and T&lt;sub&gt;eff,Aa&lt;/sub&gt;=6588 K. For the secondary the authors derived the following, M&lt;sub&gt;Ab&lt;/sub&gt;=0.8633 M⊙, R&lt;sub&gt;Ab&lt;/sub&gt; =1.154 R⊙, and T&lt;sub&gt;eff,Ab&lt;/sub&gt; =4475 K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The properties derived for the third body are significantly different to previously obtained results, with a period of 180.4 days and a minimum mass of M&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.871 M⊙. Given these results the authors argue that V1200 Cen is actually a quadruple system with a secondary pair composed of two low-mass stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12601"&gt;Detection of the Occultation of 55 Cancri e with TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Kipping et. al., 2020)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using TESS sector 21 photometry the authors have studied in detail the ultra-short period transiting Super Earth, 55 Cancri e.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The occultation depth has been measured as 15 ppm, which is a small change in brightness, but yet detectable by TESS. The brightness temperature of the object is determined as 2800 K, which is around 1.5 sigma greater than expected given the mean measured depth by Spitzer.&lt;/p&gt;

The bottom panel is the raw TESS light curve of TOI-811 with the locations of the transits marked by arrows.  TOI-811 was observed in sectors 5 and 6 with TESS's 30 minute cadence. The star is seen to exhibit periodic flux variations on the order of a few percent, these are likely due to star spots based on the changes in the patterns of the modulation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The relative flux difference is plotted in the lower panel. The linear trend seen in the flux difference was taken into account when fitting the SAP and PDCSAP light curves.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08881"&gt;TOI-481 b &amp;amp; TOI-892 b: Two long period hot Jupiters from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Brahm et. al., 2020) :&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two new giant planets with periods of 10 days have been discovered by TESS, TOI-481 b and TOI-892 b. TESS data in combination with that from ground-based facilities have been used to determine the masses 1.53 M&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt; and 0.95 M&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, radii 0.99 R&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt; and 1.07 R&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, and orbital periods 10.3311 and 10.6266 days, of the two planets respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both planets are seen to orbit metal rich stars, but at different evolutionary stages.  TOI-481 is a G-type star at  6.7 Gyrs old, whereas TOI-892 is a F-type dwarf star. Both these systems are important in understanding the formation and structure of hot Jupiters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08338"&gt;A planetary system with two transiting mini-Neptunes near the radius valley transition around the bright M dwarf TOI-776&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Luque et. al., 2020) :&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors report on the discovery of two transiting planets around LP 961-53 (TOI-776). This is a bright M1 V star, with transits detected in Sector 10 of the TESS data. Combining TESS data with HARPS radial velocity measurements, as well with data from other ground-based facilities (MEarth and LCOGT), the authors were able to measure periods, radii, and masses of the two planets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inner planet TOI-776b has a period of 8.25 d, a radius of 1.83 R&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;, and a mass of 4.66 M&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;. The outer planet, TOI-776c, has a period of 15.66 d, a radius of 2.06 R&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;, and a mass of 6.1 M&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data also indicates a 35 day rotational period for the star, this is supported by the analysis of 15 years worth of ground-based photometric monitoring data and the inspection of different spectral line indicators. Both detected planets have a significant atmospheres, with slightly different envelope mass fractions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10781"&gt;TESS Observations of the Hot Jupiter Exoplanet XO-6b: No Evidence of Transit Timing Variations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Ridden-Harper et. al., 2020) :&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using ground-based observations a hot Jupiter exoplanet, XO-6b, was reported to have apparently periodic transit timing variations (TTVs), with a semi-amplitude of 14 min and period of 450 days. It was thought that these variations were cased by an unknown low-mass planet orbiting the host star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors have used three sectors of TESS data spanning over seven months, to better understand the system. From the TESS data the authors were able to update the orbital period to 3.76 days, with a transit epoch of 2456652.7157 BJD&lt;sub&gt;TDB&lt;/sub&gt;. No evidence of TTVs were discovered in this new analysis, confirming that TTVs are rarely seen in hot Jupiters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04784"&gt;beta Cas: the first delta Scuti star with a dynamo magnetic field&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Zwintz et. al., 2020) :&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors obtain photometric time series from three different space missions: BRITE-Constellation, SMEI, and TESS. From these data the authors study the rapidly rotating delta Scuti, star beta Cas. These type of stars are characterized by several physical properties including different pulsation mechanisms, rotation, convection, diffusion, and magnetic fields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining the data to obtain four years of observations, the authors investigated the stability of the pulsation amplitudes  using frequency analysis. The magnetic field of the star was also examined using data taken with the Narval instrument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examination of the data indicates that beta Cas has three independent p-mode frequencies down to the few ppm-level with its highest amplitude frequency being an n=3, ℓ=2, m=0 mode. The magnetic  field structure is complex and likely of a dynamo origin.  Beta Cas' atmosphere is slightly deficient in iron peak elements and slightly overabundant in C, O, and heavier elements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All analysis by the authors indicates that Beta Cas is not a typical delta Scuti star. Only three pulsation modes can be detected down to low noise levels, and it has a measurable magnetic field. The fact that this might be a dynamo magnetic field, is also unusual. As such this is a very interesting star for future studies, for more information see the paper linked above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07060"&gt;The near-infrared companion to HD94660 (=KQ Vel)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Schöller et. al., 2020) :&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using data from multiple facilities, including TESS, the authors investigate the Bp star HD94660, a single-lined spectroscopic binary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This star is thought to have multiple, previously unseen, companions. Data were collected from the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (PIONIER H-band), TESS, and Chandra which provided X-ray information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From these collected data the companion to HD94660 was detected with a magnitude difference of 1.8 in the H-band at a separation of 18.72 mas. A period of 2.1 days was detected in the TESS data in addition to flaring. X-ray information indicated a hot thermal plasma, and that there might also be a non-thermal component. The overall analysis of the X-ray data suggests a magnetically active companion with some potential magnetospheric contribution from the primary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not yet obvious if the companion is a compact source or not, or if it is only one single star or multiple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2713-y"&gt;A giant planet candidate transiting a white dwarf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Vanderburg et. al., 2020) :&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astronomers have detected what may be the first intact planet around a white dwarf. This planet orbits its host, WD 1856+534, located approximately 80 light-years away in the northern constellation Draco. The WD is roughly 11,000 miles (18,000 kilometers) across, may be up to 10 billion years old, and is a distant member of a triple star system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The planet was examined using data from TESS and the retired Spitzer Space Telescope.  Named WD 1856 b, the planet has a period of 34 hrs and is about the size of Jupiter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WD 1856 b’s close proximity to its WD host is unusual as the creation of a WD typically destroys any nearby planet. It is thought that WD 1856 b must have originated at least 50 times farther away than its current orbit and migrated in over time. Several theories are presented by the authors about this migration, including the interaction with several other Jupiter-sized bodies close to the planets original orbit.  For more information about this unusual system see the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-missions-spy-first-possible-survivor-planet-hugging-white-dwarf-star"&gt;NASA press release&lt;/a&gt; and the Nature paper, linked above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello TESS followers and welcome to our weekly news bulletin! This week there are multiple papers posted to the archive that use TESS data, well done authors! This bulletin features three of these papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04317"&gt;A super-Earth and a sub-Neptune orbiting the bright, quiet M3 dwarf TOI-1266&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Demory et. al., 2020) :&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors present evidence for two planets orbiting a close (37 pc), bright (K = 8.8), M3V dwarf star known as TOI-1266.  Using TESS photometry and data from the SAINT-EX telescope, the planets are thought to be a super-Earth and sub-Neptune. The inner, larger planet has a R= 2.37 R⊕, and an orbital period of 10.9 days. The outer, smaller planet has a radius of R=1.56 R⊕ and an 18.8 day orbit. Further data analysis by the authors also allowed them to place constraints on the masses and eccentricities of the planets. The larger planet, TOI-1266 b, has a mass of M&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = 13.5 M⊕, and the smaller planet TOI-1266 c has a mass of 2.2 M⊕. The eccentricities of both planets are considered small, but non-zero at 0.09 for TOI-1266 b, and 0.04 for TOI-1266 c. See the paper for further details about this interesting system..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03378"&gt;TIC 278825952: a triply eclipsing hierarchical triple system with the most intrinsically circular outer orbit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Mitnyan et. al., 2020) :&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A compact triply eclipsing triple star system has been discovered in TESS’s southern continuous viewing zone. The system, TIC 278825952, is a circular eclipsing binary with a period of 4.78 days, with a tertiary component in a wider, circular orbit of 235.55 days. Analysis by the authors indicates that the inner binary contains slightly evolved, almost twin stars, of 1.12 M⊙ and 1.09 M⊙, with radii of 1.41 R⊙ and 1.31 R⊙. The third star has a lower mass of 0.75 M⊙ and and radius of 0.7R⊙. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03321"&gt;ASASSN-14ko is a Periodic Nuclear Transient in ESO 253-G003&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Payne et. al., 2020) :&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors present a study of ASASSN-14ko. This object was originally classified as a supernova close to its hosts nucleus by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae. Further observation of the event has however revealed its true nature, as a nuclear flare occurring at regular intervals. There have been 17 further outburst, with the most recent in May 2020. Using these multiple events there is now evidence of a decreasing period over time, with a mean of P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 114.2 days. TESS observed an outburst in sectors 4-6, revealing a rise time of 5.6 days in the optical and a decline that best fits an exponential model. Data combined from multiple facilities suggest that this is a repeated partial tidal disruption event. Further discussion of the possible scenarios for ASASSN-14ko are presented in this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers to our weekly news bulletin!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12535"&gt;The TOI-763 system: sub-Neptunes orbiting a Sun-like star&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Fridlund et. al., 2020) :&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors report the discovery of a planetary system orbiting TOI-763, also known as CD-29 7945. This is a bright (V = 10.2), high proper motion G-type dwarf star. Using spectra the star was found to be slightly smaller than the Sun, a little older, and with a similar metallically. The system was observed in TESS sector 10 data and using the light curve two planet candidates were found to be transiting the star. TESS and HARPS high-precision radial velocity follow-up measurements were used to confirm the planets. The authors determine the mass, radii, and bulk densities for the two planets, they also discovered a third potential planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inner most planet, TOI-763 b, has an orbital period of P&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; = 5.6 days, a mass of M&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; =9.8 M⊕, and a radius of R&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.37 R⊕. TOI-763 c, has an orbital period of P&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = 12.3 days, M&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = 9.3 M⊕, and a radius of R&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.87 R⊕. The third outermost planet candidate orbits the star with a period of 48 days. Although not yet confirmed as a planet, if it were it would have a minimum mass of M&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; = 9.5 M⊕. The paper goes on to discuss the importance and implications of the system in terms of the geometrical arrangements of planets orbiting G-type stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11732"&gt;TOI-824 b: A New Planet on the Lower Edge of the Hot Neptune Desert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;( Burt et. al., 2020) :&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors present the detection of a hot Neptune exoplanet orbiting TOI-824 (SCR J1448-5735) using TESS data. TOI-824 is a close by (d = 64 pc) K4V star. The orbital period of the planet is given as 1.393 days and the radius as 2.93 R⊕. The planet was confirmed using radial velocity measurements from the Planet Finder Spectrograph and the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher. Data from these instruments indicate the planets mass as 18.47 M⊕, with a density of  4.03 g cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; making it twice as dense as Neptune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TOI-824 b is thought to have a high equilibrium temperature and thus likely to have a cloud free atmosphere. These facts make TOI-824 b a good candidate for follow-up atmospheric studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07462"&gt;Bow-shocks, nova shells, disc winds and tilted discs: The Nova-Like V341 Ara Has It All&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Castro Segura et. al., 2020Balona 2020) :&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V341 Ara is one of the closest (d ~150pc), and brightest (V~10) nova-like cataclysmic variables known to date. A bright emission nebula surrounds this binary system and is likely a remnant of recent nova eruptions. In this nebula there is a bow-shock, which is thought to be caused by the accretion wind running into the nova shell. This paper presents the first multi-wavelength study of V341 Ara and utilizes high-cadenced photometry from TESS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quasi-periodic, super-orbital variations with a time-scale of 10-16 days are detected at an amplitude of roughly one mag. The photometry from TESS revealed for the first time both the orbital and “negative superhump” periods. This “negative superhump” tends to point to a tilted accretion disc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spectroscopic data indicated anti-phased absorption and emission line components, the radial velocities of which suggested a high mass ratio. This high mass ratio implies an unusually low white dwarf mass. The wind mass-loss rate of the system was also obtained from the spatially resolved [Oiii] emission produced in the bow-shock, and used to test and calibrate accretion disc wind models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is evidence which points to an association between V341 Ara and a “guest star” mentioned in Chinese historical records in AD124. If this association is accurate then this would mark the date of the nova eruption, making V341 Ara the oldest recovered nova of its class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07522"&gt;Alone but not lonely: Observational evidence that binary interaction is always required to form hot subdwarf stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Pelisoli et. al., 2020) :&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the authors use data from TESS to investigate hot subdwarfs. Hot subdwarfs are core-helium burning stars that are believed to form when a red giant star undergoes extreme mass loss. This extreme mass loss is thought to occur due to binary interaction, but the high fraction of apparently single hot subdwarfs has cast doubt on this assumption and necessitated the need for further formation models. Such models would also have to account for hot subdwarfs in wide binary systems, which experience no interaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using TESS data the authors probe for the existence of such non interacting binary hot subdwarfs. TESS light curves were analyzed for all known hot subdwarfs with a main sequence wide binary companion. The authors also search for common proper motion pairs to spectroscopically confirmed hot subdwarfs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results indicated that companions in composite hot subdwarfs show short rotation periods when compared to field main sequence stars. They display a triangular-shaped distribution with a peak around 2.5 days, similar to what is observed for young open clusters. This observed distribution of rotation rates for the companions in known wide hot subdwarf binaries provides evidence of previous interaction causing spin-up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A shortage of hot subdwarfs are found with candidate common proper motion companions, considering the frequency of such systems among progenitors. The authors identify only 16 candidates after probing 2938 hot subdwarfs with good astrometry. Out of those, at least six seem to be hierarchical triple systems, in which the hot subdwarf is part of an inner binary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of the investigation suggest that binary interaction is always required for the formation of hot subdwarfs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello TESS followers, and welcome to our weekly news bulletin! This week we present three TESS papers from the archive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06305"&gt;Spots and flares in hot main sequence stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Balona 2020) :&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello TESS followers, and welcome to our weekly news bulletin! This week we present three TESS papers from the archive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06305"&gt;Spots and flares in hot main sequence stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Balona 2020) :&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper the author examines spectral type A and B stars in search of variability. Combining data from TESS Sectors 1 through 24, nearly 6000 stars have been classified according to variability. Previous analysis of A and late B stars has indicated that these are rotational variables. This paper presents evidence that rotational modulation is present even among the early B stars. Using TESS data, a search for A and B star flares was conducted which led to the detection of 110 flares in 68 stars. The energies of these flares are greater than those of typical K and M dwarfs by approximately two orders of magnitude. The results of this paper indicate that we need to revise our current understanding of the outer layers of stars with radiative envelopes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05372"&gt;The GALAH Survey: Using Galactic Archaeology to Refine our Knowledge of TESS Target Stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Clark et. al., 2020) :&lt;/em&gt;
The authors of this paper have cross-matched spectroscopic, photometric, and astrometric data from the GALAH Data Release 2, Gaia Data Release 2, and the TESS input catalogue in order to create a catalog of physical and chemical properties for 47,285 stars. Data from this combined catalog was used to derive isochrone masses and radii which are precise to within 5%. The authors also used their catalogue to revise the parameters of 12 TESS planetary systems, including CTOI-20125677. Their work indicated that CTOI-20125677 may not actually be a planetary system since the revised radii are closer to stellar sizes. Using molecular ratios, the authors determined the composition and structure of planets with R&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 4 R&amp;#8853;. The ratio’s examined indicated that 36% of the planets fall within 2 sigma of the Sun/Earth values, suggesting that the stars may host rocky exoplanets similar in composition to those found within our own Solar system. &lt;/p&gt;

KIC 10685175 (TIC 264509538) is a rapidly oscillating Ap star. The star was detected in long cadence Kepler data using super-Nyquist frequency analysis. Using TESS 2-min cadenced data the object has since been re-analyzed and the authors have determined that the previous frequency is a Nyquist alias. The new pulsation frequency of the star is 7..52 min with a rotation frequency of 3.1 days. The star is an oblique pulsator with pulsation amplitude modulated by the rotation, reaching pulsation amplitude maximum at the time of the rotational light minimum. Additional examination has indicated that this star is pulsating in a distorted quadrupole mode, with distortion caused potentially by a strong magnetic field. &lt;/p&gt;

Over the next 27 months, TESS will conduct additional observations of the celestial sphere intended to enhance the scientific output of the mission. The Extended Mission will include updates to the data collection modes and the methods of target selection, as well as observations of the ecliptic plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="observations"&gt;Observations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the first year of the Extended Mission, TESS will re-observe the southern ecliptic hemisphere. Because of the natural variation in the period of the TESS orbit over time, the fields observed will not overlap exactly with those observed during Year 1: as a result, many targets that fell in the gaps between sectors, cameras, and CCDs during Year 1 will be observed for the first time in Year 3. The details of the pointings during Year 3 can be found on &lt;a href="https://tess.mit.edu/observations"&gt;https://tess.mit.edu/observations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pointings during the final 15 months of the Extended Mission will cover part of the northern ecliptic hemisphere and ~60% of the ecliptic. The exact details of the ecliptic pointings will be available in the fall of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="data-collection-modes"&gt;Data Collection Modes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Extended Mission, data will be collected from approximately 20,000 targets per sector at two-minute cadence, just as they were during the Prime Mission. The TESS team has added a 20 second data collection mode: up to 1000 targets per sector will be observed at this cadence, of which nominally 400 are photometric calibration targets and 600 are science targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Extended Mission, the full-frame image (FFI) cadence was reduced from 30 minutes to 10 minutes to enable a broader range of science investigations to be executed using FFI data than was possible with the primary mission cadence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="target-selection"&gt;Target Selection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Prime Mission, the majority of the two-minute target slots was assigned to stars around which small exoplanets might be found, and the remainder was shared between targets selected by the Guest Investigator (GI) program and Director’s Discretionary Time (DDT) targets. In the Extended Mission, the majority (~80%) of targets per sector will come from GI programs, and the remainder split between DDT targets and exoplanet targets. Exoplanet targets are chosen by the TESS project and include existing TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs) and targets from the original exoplanet Candidate Target List (CTL) that fell into gaps between CCDs or sectors during the Prime Mission: exoplanet targets from Year 1 will generally not be observed at two-minute cadence unless they were a TOI or are included in an accepted GI proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of GI selected programs for Year 3 of the TESS Mission (Extended Mission Year 1) is available on the TESS &lt;a href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/approved-programs.html"&gt;GI website&lt;/a&gt;. Specific two-minute and 20s targets to be observed are determined shortly before the sector begins. The list of GI targets draws from both selected programs and those that were deemed good proposals but were not selected for funding. Targets for each sector are listed on the &lt;a href="https://tess.mit.edu/observations/target-lists/"&gt;MIT website&lt;/a&gt;, and broken down by GI program on the &lt;a href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/approved-programs.html"&gt;GI website&lt;/a&gt;. The call for Cycle 4 targets, covering the last 15 months of the Extended Mission, will come out in the fall of 2020, with a proposal deadline in early 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Director’s Discretionary targets are allocated by the TESS PI (George Ricker) after review of the proposed observations.  Requests for DDT targets can be made by email to &lt;a href="mailto:tess-ddt@mit.edu"&gt;tess-ddt@mit.edu&lt;/a&gt;: details of the procedure and documents required for DDT requests can be found at &lt;a href="https://tess.mit.edu/science/ddt/"&gt;https://tess.mit.edu/science/ddt/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both two-minute and 20s cadence targets are solicited by the GI and DDT programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="data-processing-and-data-products"&gt;Data Processing and Data Products&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Extended Mission, the FFI and two-minute cadence data will be processed by the Science Processing Operations Center (SPOC) in the same way as in the Prime Mission (see &lt;a href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/docs/jenkinsSPIE2016-copyright.pdf"&gt;Jenkins et al. 2016&lt;/a&gt;). The two-minute cadence data will be run through the SPOC’s Transiting Planet Search (TPS) module, and Data Validation (DV) reports will be generated for all Threshold Crossing Events (TCEs). The TESS Science Office at MIT will review all TCEs in a search for signals of transiting planets and release TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs), as was done in the Prime Mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new 20s data products will be processed by SPOC into target pixel and light curve files with the same format as those created from two-minute data. These data will not be run through TPS, so no DV products or reports will be created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One key difference in the 20s data products is that cosmic-rays are removed in ground processing at SPOC, rather than on orbit, as is done for two-minute data and FFIs. The processed target-pixel data includes a FITS extension that identifies the cosmic ray correction applied for affected pixels along with the (row, column) coordinate and cadence at which the cosmic rays were removed, allowing the observer to revert the data to its raw state and make their own custom corrections, if desired. The collateral pixel data files contain cosmic ray extensions with similar information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of collateral pixels collected is lower in the Extended Mission to preserve space on the on-board solid-state recorder. For two-minute data, all leading black and the first two trailing black pixels will no longer be collected, as these were not useful for measuring CCD bias level during the Prime Mission. For 20s data, collateral pixels will be collected only in the columns and rows in which a target pixel was selected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Prime Mission, data were typically released publicly via the &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/tess/"&gt;MAST&lt;/a&gt; approximately a month after being downlinked to the ground. We anticipate maintaining this timeline during the Extended Mission. However, for the first Extended Mission sector (Sector 27), we are planning to extend the usual timeline between data downlink and public release to allow the mission team time to vet and document the new data collection modes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="news"></category></entry><entry><title>TESS Weekly Bulletin: August 12th</title><link href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/tess-weekly-bulletin-august-12th.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-08-12T10:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-08-12T10:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Rebekah Hounsell</name></author><id>tag:heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov,2020-08-12:/docs/tess/tess-weekly-bulletin-august-12th.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;STATUS UPDATE: Data from the last Sector of the TESS Prime mission is currently being ingested at the archive.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello TESS followers, and welcome to our weekly news bulletin! This week we have a slightly shorter news bulletin, featuring two archival paper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03351"&gt;Astraea: Predicting Long Rotation Periods with 27-Day Light Curves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Yuxi et. al., 2020) :&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radial velocity (RV) measurements can be affected by magnetic activity. The rotation periods of the planet-hosting star can be used to model and mitigate this effect, and can also be used to constrain the high-energy flux environment and space weather for the planetary system. Traditional methods require  a long and continuous baseline of observations to measure RV accurately, especially for M dwarfs, the ideal exoplanet candidates. Within this paper the authors present their new tool &lt;em&gt;Astraea&lt;/em&gt;, which can be used to predict rotation periods in excess of the TESS 27-day observing baseline. The method presented combines short duration light curves with stellar parameters from Gaia DR2. The tool was trained on Kepler 27-day light curve segments, and then applied to 195 stars within the TESS data. Of these 195 stars observed by both TESS and Kepler, &lt;em&gt;Astraea&lt;/em&gt; was able to predict the rotation periods with 55% uncertainty, despite significant differences in the systematics of the two missions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02789"&gt;Low Albedo Surfaces of Lava Worlds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Essack et. al., 2020) :&lt;/em&gt;
A hot super Earth is an exoplanet with a short orbital period of less than 10 days. These planets are heated to a high temperature by the host star causing the rocky surface to become molten. Some hot super Earths exhibit high geometric albedos. The authors of this paper aim to determine if the reflection from molten lava and quenched glasses on the surfaces of a hot super Earth contributes to the observationally inferred high geometric albedos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this they  measure reflection from rough and smooth textured quenched glasses of both basalt and feldspar melts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation indicates that lava planets with solid or liquid surfaces have low albedos. High albedos observed are likely due to atmospheres with reflective clouds. The authors went on to identify potential lava-ocean planet candidates within the TESS object of interest (TOI) list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lava-ocean planet candidates are those with substellar temperatures &amp;gt; 850 K (Fig. 12 of Essack et. al., 2020).&lt;/p&gt;

This week we report on three new papers from the archive, in addition to a new and interesting website that will aid in TESS observations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week a new website was launched by the &lt;a href="https://www.stsci.edu"&gt;Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI)&lt;/a&gt;, for the &lt;a href="https://ullyses.stsci.edu"&gt;UV Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES)&lt;/a&gt;. This is a program in which the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) will devote ~1000 orbits to the production of a UV spectroscopic library of young high- and low- mass stars in the local universe. It is a Directors Discretionary program which is now live. In particular, the ULLYSES website contains the program ID and scheduling information for targets already observed or in the long-range plan; currently this includes stars in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, and the Orion T Tauri stars scheduled to be observed in November-December 2020 to coincide with TESS observations. The ULLYSES website will continue to be updated with additional program and scheduling information as it becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now onto our three archive papers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10995"&gt;Transits of Known Planets Orbiting a Naked-Eye Star&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Kane et. al., 2020):&lt;/em&gt;
TESS data is used in combination with observations by HARPS, Keck/HIRES and the AAT, in order to perform a complete analysis of the HD 136352 system parameters. HD 136352  is a naked eye G-type main sequence star that is host to three planets with orbital periods of 11.6, 27.6, and 108.1 days. This paper focuses on the detection and characterization of traits for the two inner planets. Radii of 1.48 R&amp;#8853;, and 2.608 R&amp;#8853; for planets b and c, respectively were derived. From the combined data analysis, bulk density values of &amp;#961;&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;  = 7.8~gcm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; and &amp;#961;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; 3.5~gcm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; for planets b and c were extracted, placing them on either side of the radius valley.&lt;/p&gt;

The authors have used 27 days of photometry from TESS  to characterize solar-like oscillations in the G8 subgiant of the 94 Aqr triple system. Using the stellar properties derived in combined with 35 years of data from the Mount Wilson HK project, the authors were able to probe the evolution of rotation and magnetic activity in the system. The asteroseismic age of the subgiant agrees with the isochrone derived age, but the rotation period is much shorter. Hypothesizes are presented by the authors to explain the stellar properties determined.&lt;/p&gt;

The authors present the discovery of a small, short period (~ 4 days) transiting planet around the bright (V=7.9) star HD 86226. This solar-like star was known to already host a long-period (~1600 day) giant planet.  The newly detected planet is named HD 86226c, has a radius of 2.16 R&amp;#8853; and mass of 7.26 M&amp;#8853;, based on new and archival measurements. The authors also update the parameters of the additional planet in the system which is not known to transit. This planet is less eccentric and less massive than previously thought. HD 86226c is  near both the ''radius gap'' and the ''hot Neptune desert'', which makes it an interesting candidate for transmission spectroscopy to further refine its composition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers to this week's news bulletin! This week we present three papers using TESS data from the archive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05528"&gt;HAT-P-58b -- HAT-P-64b: Seven Planets Transiting Bright Stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Bakos et. al., 2020):&lt;/em&gt;
In this paper the authors report the discovery and characterization of seven transiting exoplanets from the  &lt;a href="https://hatnet.org"&gt;HATNet&lt;/a&gt; survey. The planets discovered are all hot Jupiters and Saturns, transiting bright sun-like stars. The names of the planets are HAT-P-58b (mass M = 0.37 M&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, radius R = 1.33 R&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, and orbital period P = 4.0138 days), HAT-P-59b (M = 1.54 M&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, R = 1.12 R&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, P = 4.1420 days), HAT-P-60b (M = 0.57 M&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, R = 1.63 R&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, P = 4.7948 days), HAT-P-61b (M = 1.06 M&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, R = 0.90 R&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, P = 1.9023 days), HAT-P-62b (M = 0.76 M&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, R = 1.07 R&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, P = 2.6453 days), HAT-P-63b (M = 0.61 M&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, R = 1.12 R&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, P = 3.3777 days), and HAT-P-64b (M = 0.58 M&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, R = 1.70 R&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, P = 4.0072 days). The authors also present accurate stellar parameters for each host star. TESS long-cadenced data is used in the analysis of five of the seven systems. Of particular note is HAT-P-59 (TOI-1826.01) which is within the Northern continuous viewing zone of the TESS mission, and HAT-P-60, otherwise known as TESS candidate TOI-1580.01.&lt;/p&gt;

The authors confirm the planetary nature of a warm Jupiter transiting an M0 dwarf designated TOI-1899.
The confirmation was made using photometric data from TESS, near-infrared spectroscopy with the Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF), and speckle and adaptive optics imaging. The transiting planet has an orbit of 29 days, a mass of 0.66 M&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, and a radius of 1.37 R&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;. TOI-1899 is the lowest mass star known to host a transiting  “puffy warm Jupiter”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07999"&gt;Multi-Wavelength Variability of BL Lacertae Measured with High Time Resolution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Weaver et al., 2020):&lt;/em&gt;
This paper aims to  increase our understanding of variability in blazer jets. To do this the authors have obtained high time resolution observations of BL Lacertae in multiple bands, using multiple facilities  including TESS, the Neil Gehrels Swift satellite, the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, the Fermi Large Area Telescope, and the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope for optical flux density and polarization measurements.  All light curves are correlated, with similar structure on timescales from hours to days. The shortest timescale of variability is in the optical and observed with TESS at ~0.5 hr. The most common timescale is 13hrs, and is similar to the X-ray variability.  Studies by the authors using the multi-frequency probes indicate that the timescales of variability observed, cross-frequency lags, and polarization properties can be explained "by turbulent plasma that is energized by a shock in the jet and subsequently loses energy to synchrotron and inverse Compton radiation in a magnetic field of strength ∼ 3 G." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers to this week's news bulletin! This week we present three papers using TESS data from the archive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03079"&gt;A search for rotation periods in 1000 TESS objects of interest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Martins et. al., 2020):&lt;/em&gt;
The high cadence, high quality light curves provided by the TESS mission allow for the exploration of stellar rotation. Studying stellar rotation is important as it aids in our understanding of planetary evolution, planetary atmospheres, habitability conditions, and as such the potential for life around a given star. This paper exploits ~1000 objects of interest observed by TESS with a 2 minute cadence. Using Fast Fourier transform, Lomb-Scargle, and wavelet techniques the authors searched  for rotation signatures and found 163 targets with such signatures. Of these targets 131 have unambiguous rotation periods ranging from 0.321 to 13.219 days. In addition the analysis revealed 10 stars with pulsation periodicities ranging from 0.049 to 2.995 days, and four eclipsing binaries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04071"&gt;TESS observations of southern ultra fast rotating low mass stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Ramsey et. al., 2020):&lt;/em&gt;
In  this paper the authors present results following a systematic search for ultra fast rotators using TESS 2-min cadence, southern ecliptic hemisphere data. Using Gaia DR2 data they identify 609 stars which lie on the lower main sequence and have a period modulation &amp;lt; 1 day. When the period drops to &amp;lt; 0.2 days the fraction of stars which show flares drops as well.  Faster rotators are meant to have stronger magnetic fields and therefore more flares, as such it is unlikely that the periods are a signature of the rotation rate. The paper goes on to explore the possible reasons for its findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04653"&gt;The TESS light curve of the eccentric eclipsing binary 1SWASP J011351.29+314909.7 -- no evidence for a very hot M-dwarf companion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Swayne et. al., 2020):&lt;/em&gt;
In 2014  the M-dwarf companion of the eclipsing binary star 1SWASPJ011351.29+314909.7 (J0113+31, primary mass of 0.95 M&amp;#8857;) was reported to have an unusually high effective temperature. This effective temperature was inferred from the secondary eclipse death  and was ~ 600 K higher than values predicted from stellar models. The result cast doubt on our understanding of low-mass stars and thus our ability to infer the properties of exoplanets orbiting them. Using TESS data the authors have re-examined the  M dwarf and derive effective temperature of  3208 &amp;#177; 43 K, assuming log g2 = 5, [Fe/H] = 0.4 and no alpha-element enhancement. Even if these assumptions are varied the authors found that the effective temperature changed by only 100K and as such the results do not support a large anomaly between observed and theoretical low-mass star temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;

The sample is drawn only from stars that are brighter than TESS 14th magnitude. As the period gets shorter there is a decline in the number of stars, and a rapid drop at periods &amp;lt; 0.2 d. The mean mag of stars in each bin is also displayed, with no significant change over the period range.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers to this week's news bulletin! This week we present two papers using TESS data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00678"&gt;The K2 &amp;amp; TESS Synergy I: Updated Ephemerides and Parameters for K2-114, K2-167, K2-237, &amp;amp; K2-261&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Ikwut-Ukwa, et. al., 2020):&lt;/em&gt;
Within this paper the authors took advantage of overlapping regions within the TESS and K2 missions. From these combined photometric data, and archival spectroscopic observations, they were able to globally model four known planetary systems discovered using K2. The paper provides updated ephemerides and system parameters for K2-114 b, K2-167 b, K2-237 b, and K2-261 b. Three of the planets examined are Jovian sized and one is a sub-Neptune, with orbital periods of less than12 days. The revised ephemeris presented here significantly reduce the uncertainty in the prediction of future times of transit, which is important when considering James Webb Space Telescope observations. The resultant work means that the authors can confidently predict the future transit times to ~1 hr through the extent of the JWST prime mission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00497"&gt;Tess asteroseismology of the known planet host star &amp;#955;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Fornacis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Nielsen et. al., 2020):&lt;/em&gt;
This paper uses TESS observations to characterize the star &amp;#955;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Fornacis, and thus update the parameters of the orbiting planet &amp;#955;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  For b. Fundamental properties of the star are estimated using stellar models. These improved stellar properties are then combined with archival time-series of RV data from the UCLES, HIRES and HARPS instruments spanning almost 20 years, and the orbit of &amp;#955;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  For b refit. The RV residuals are also examined for remaining variability. The paper determines that &amp;#955;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; has a mass of 1.16 M&amp;#8857; and a radius of 1.63 R&amp;#8857;, with an age of 6.3 Gyr. The mass of  &amp;#955;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  For b is therefore determined as 16.8 M&amp;#8853;, which is ~5 M&amp;#8853; less than previous literature estimates. The RV measurements also indicate a periodicity of 33 days, this is most likely the rotation of the host star.  Asteroseismic measurements  place the star at the early stage of the sub-giant evolutionary phase. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello TESS followers and welcome to this week's news bulletin! This week we present four papers using TESS data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2400-z"&gt;A planet within the debris disk around the pre-main-sequence star AU Microscopii&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Plavchan et. al., 2020):&lt;/em&gt;
AU Microscopii (AU Mic) is a neighboring pre-main sequence star only 22 million years old and located 31.9 light years away in the southern constellation Microscopium. This cool red dwarf star possesses an edge-on debris disc and within this disc a planet transit has been detected! Using TESS and Spitzer observations, physical properties of the planet, known as AU Mic b, have been derived. It possesses an orbital period of 8.46 days, is located  at a distance of 0.07 AU from the host, has a radius of 0.4 R&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;, and mass less than 0.18 M&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;. For more information on this fascinating object please see our &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2020/nasa-s-tess-spitzer-missions-discover-a-world-orbiting-a-unique-young-star"&gt;feature page&lt;/a&gt;. AU Mic b is also featured in a new NASA poster available in English and Spanish, as part of a &lt;a href="https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/alien-worlds/galaxy-of-horrors/"&gt;Galaxy of Horrors&lt;/a&gt; series.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11180"&gt;A Mini-Neptune and a Venus-Zone Planet in the Radius Valley Orbiting the Nearby M2-dwarf TOI-1266: Validation with the Habitable-zone Planet Finder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Stefansson et. al., 2020):&lt;/em&gt;
Two planets are validated within this paper using TESS data. The planets orbit an M2 dwarf known as TOI-1266 which is 36pc away. The inner planet is a sub-Neptune with a radius of 2.46 R&amp;#8853; and an orbital period of 10.9 days. The outer planet is smaller with a radius of 1.67 R&amp;#8853;, has an orbital period of 18.8 days, and is in the exoplanet Radius Valley, a region of transition between rocky and gaseous planets. Given the outer planet's location it receives 2.4 times the amount of insolation flux compared to the Earth, this is similar to that for Venus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10806"&gt;Optical detection of the 1.1-day variability at the white dwarf GD 394 with TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Wilson et al., 2020):&lt;/em&gt;
This paper uses TESS data to examine GD 394, a hot white dwarf which exhibits a unique 1.15 d flux variation which was detected by the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE) back in the mid 1990's. The variation of this object is unknown but several hypothesis exist including channeled accretion producing a dark spot of metals, occultation by a gas cloud from an evaporating planet, or heating from a flux tube produced by an orbiting iron-cored planetesimal. The TESS observations presented  here are the first outside of the EUV regime and demonstrate a 0.12% flux variation with a period of 1.146 d, which is consistent with the EUVE measurements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10449"&gt;The Compact Triply Eclipsing Triple Star TIC 209409435 Discovered with TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Borkovits et. al., 2020):&lt;/em&gt;
In Sectors 3 and 4 of TESS data a compact triple eclipsing star system was discovered by the authors. TIC 209409435 is a previously unknown eclipsing binary with a period of 5.717 days and a third star found in an eccentric orbit with a period of 121.872 days. This third star exhibits signatures of strong 3rd-body perturbations. After much analysis and study, the authors find that the inner binary consists of near twin stars of mass 0.9 M&amp;#8857;, and radius 0.88 R&amp;#8857;. The third star is 9% more massive and has and 18% larger radius. The eccentricity of the  inner binary is small while the outer orbit has e=0.40. The inner binary and outer orbit have inclination angles within 0.1&amp;#176; and 0.2&amp;#176; of 90&amp;#176;, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello TESS followers and welcome to this week's news bulletin! This week we present three papers using TESS data, on the archive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09750"&gt;TESS unveils the optical phase curve of KELT-1b. Thermal emission and ellipsoidal variation from the brown dwarf companion, and activity from the star&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Essen et al., 2020):&lt;/em&gt;
The authors analyze data obtained by TESS for KELT-1b, a low mass (27 M&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;) brown dwarf. The TESS light curve of the host star shows clear ellipsoidal variations due to the high mass and close proximity of its companion. Using TESS data the authors determine the most accurate secondary eclipse depth to date of KELT-1b, 304 &amp;#177; 75 parts-per-million (ppm). The amplitude of the phase curve is also measured and given as 128 &amp;#177; 27 ppm, and a day and night brightness temperature of 3201 &amp;#177; 147 K and 1484 &amp;#177; 110 K, respectively, obtained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08979"&gt;TIC 278956474: Two close binaries in one young quadruple system, identified by TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Rowden et al., 2020):&lt;/em&gt;
The authors of this paper have identified a quadruple system with two close eclipsing binaries using TESS data. The two binaries have observable primary and secondary eclipses. For one of the eclipsing binary systems the period is 5.488 days and the smaller star is full occluded by the larger in the secondary eclipse. In the other binary system the period is 5.674 days and both eclipses are grazing. Combining the TESS observations with spectroscopy and speckle photometry the masses and radii of the four stars are obtained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07649"&gt;Asteroseismic masses of four evolved planet-hosting stars using SONG and TESS: resolving the retired A-star mass controversy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Malla et al.,  2020):&lt;/em&gt;
Four evolved planet-hosting stars are presented in this paper with the aim of resolving some of the issues regarding planet occurrence as a function of stellar mass in the red giant regime. Using asteroseismology, these four stars are examined in addition to previous results such that a self-consistent study is performed. The seismic masses of the full set of 16 stars are compared with spectroscopic masses from the literature. The authors find an offset between the two mass scales that is mass-dependent and indicates that a previously claimed overestimation of spectroscopic masses only affects stars more massive than 1.6 M&amp;#8857;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello TESS followers and welcome to this weeks news bulletin! This week we have three papers from the archive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03012"&gt;Photometric detection of internal gravity waves in upper main-sequence stars. II. Combined TESS photometry and high-resolution spectroscopy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Bowman et al., 2020):&lt;/em&gt;
This paper combines high precision TESS light curves with high resolution ground based spectroscopy for 70 O and B stars to test the relationship between photometric signatures and internal gravity waves parameters. 
Internal gravity waves are thought to occur in massive stars via turbulent core convection and from turbulent pressure fluctuations in surface layers.&lt;br /&gt;
The authors determine that there is a relationship between the location of a star on the spectroscopic Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and the amplitudes and frequencies of its random light curve variability. The macroturbulent velocity broadening in the spectral lines of these stars are also correlated to the properties of the stochastic variability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04126"&gt;Mode identification in three pulsating hot subdwarfs observed with TESS satellite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Sahoo et al 2020):&lt;/em&gt;
Within this paper three pulsating subdwarf B (sdB) stars are examined using TESS data, TIC 067584818, TIC 169285097, and TIC 457168745. In each star a few tens of frequencies/ oscillations are detected. No multiplets were detected in this work. Using high precision trigonometric parallaxes from Gaia and spectral energy distributions the atmospheric parameters were converted into stellar ones. The Radii, masses and luminosities for these three stars are typical for extreme horizontal branch stars (mass ~0.47Msun).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02106"&gt;The GALAH survey: Lithium-rich giant stars require multiple formation channels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Martell 2020):&lt;/em&gt;
In this paper data from GALA, K2-HERMES and TESS-HERMES are used to instigate the properties of 1306 red giant stars with high photospheric abundances of Lithium (Li). The paper aims to understand proposed mechanisms for lithium enrichment in giant stars. The authors confirm that Li giant stars are rare and make up only 1.1% of the sample examined. Further analysis revealed that red clump stars are three times more likely to be Li-rich as red giant branch stars, and that the occurrence rate of Li richness with metallicity is different between the two populations. The likelihood of a rapidly rotating giant being Li rich is higher than a non rapid rotator, independent of its evolutionary state. Stars on the red clump which rapidly rotate have extreme levels of Li enrichment, where as no stars on the secondary red clump have Li abundances above the primordial level. The authors work indicates that there is a mass dependence in the Li enrichment mechanism. The complex distribution of Li indicated in this paper suggests that there are multiple independent mechanisms for Li production.&lt;/p&gt;

These data will be ingested into the MAST archive over the next few months. A full list of the changes to the data will be described in the Data Release Note 30 that will accompany the first set of reprocessed data. Users can refer to the data release number in the headers of the data files in order to distinguish between the new and original data files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the reprocessed data are ingested, MAST will only be making accessible the newer version of the light curve, target pixel and FFI files for each sector. Only the reprocessed data will be available through the MAST services, including the Portal, &lt;a href="https://mast.stsci.edu/tesscut/"&gt;TESScut&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://exo.mast.stsci.edu/"&gt;exo.MAST&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://registry.opendata.aws/tess/"&gt;Amazon Web Services&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/tess/bulk_downloads.html"&gt;bulk downloads&lt;/a&gt;. The Data Validation files associated with the TESS planet search TCEs will continue to be available for both the original data and the reprocessed data through the MAST portal and bulk downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data availability tables on the &lt;a href="https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/TESS/TESS+Holdings+Available+by+MAST+Service"&gt;TESS Holdings Available by MAST Service&lt;/a&gt; page will be updated to indicate which sectors of reprocessed data are available through the different MAST Services as it is being ingested. Prior to a sector being ingested, the original data files will be taken down. As a result the MAST expects data for that sector to be unavailable for ~1 day while the new data is being ingested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first sectors to be reprocessed are those in the northern hemisphere, Sectors 14-19, followed by the southern hemisphere Sectors 1-13. The ingest of these data files will begin in mid-June at a cadence of one reprocessed sector becoming live each week except when new TESS data is available. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="news"></category></entry><entry><title>Fifth TESS Weekly Bulletin</title><link href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/fifth-tess-weekly-bulletin.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-06-03T22:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-06-03T22:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Rebekah Hounsell</name></author><id>tag:heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov,2020-06-03:/docs/tess/fifth-tess-weekly-bulletin.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;STATUS UPDATE: Cycle 3 selections have now been made!&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello TESS followers, and welcome to our fifth news bulletin! This week we are happy to announce the selection of our Cycle 3 extended mission targets, and highlight several papers now listed on arXiv.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within Cycle 3 selected programs loosely fell into the following categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exoplanets: 16&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stellar astrophysics + asteroseismology: 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extragalactic science: 8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Binary stars: 16&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cool star activity: 4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solar system science: 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week's paper highlights are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01721"&gt;A search for young exoplanets in Sectors 1-5 of the TESS Full-Frame-Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Battley et al., 2020)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
This paper aims to study young exoplanets which represent an important aspect of exoplanet research as they allow us to learn about formation and early evolution. Finding a young exoplanet is however difficult because of fast rotation and the activity of their host stars. Many pipelines struggle to deal with the complexities of such systems. The paper presents the LOWESS-based pipeline which is designed to de-trend young stellar light-curves from TESS’s 30min-cadence Full Frame Images (FFIs). The pipeline is applied to sectors 1-5 of the TESS data and although no new candidates are found the authors did recover the signal of the young exoplanet DS Tuc Ab, a number of young eclipsing binaries and a wide array of interesting rotation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00946"&gt;TESS photometry of extreme helium stars PV Tel and V821 Cen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Jeffery et al., 2020)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
TESS observations of two bright PV Tel variables are presented within this paper. PV Tel variables are EHe stars, known to show variability on timescales of 0.1 - 25 days. PV Tel stars examined in this paper are V821 Cen and PV Tel itself. The variability found in this paper for PV Tel is consistent with previous observations, whereas V821 Cen is observed to vary for the first time. The light-curves for the two objects do not show underlying regularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14201"&gt;The ASAS-SN Catalog of Variable Stars VIII: "Dipper" Stars in the Lupus Star-Forming Region&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Bredall et al 2020)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
T Tauri-like "dipper" stars are the focus of this paper. These young stellar objects show variations caused by the  partial occultation of the star by circumstellar dust. Observations of these objects inform us of the planet-forming zones around the stars. The authors have examined 11 dipper stars in the Lupus star forming region in data from the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae. The objects are characterized in this paper using data from the Las Cumbres Global Observatory Telescope and TESS (+ additional archival data). The authors determine that all stars examined are above or red-ward of the zero-age main sequence and have infrared excesses which suggest the presence of full circumstellar disks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are excited to announce the &lt;a href="approved-programs.html"&gt;selected programs&lt;/a&gt; from the Cycle 3 review of proposals. This was a particularly competitive process this year, with over 150 proposal received. The science investigations selected cover a broad range of topics, from studies of comets in our own Solar System to searching for the counterparts of gamma-ray bursts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the selected programs get the top priority slots for 20-s and 2-min cadence target observations, we will be able to select many more targets for observation than we can support through funding. Therefore, a large number of the programs submitted will have targets selected for observation. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="news"></category></entry><entry><title>Fourth TESS Weekly Bulletin</title><link href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/fourth-tess-weekly-bulletin.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-05-27T22:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-05-27T22:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Rebekah Hounsell</name></author><id>tag:heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov,2020-05-27:/docs/tess/fourth-tess-weekly-bulletin.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers to our fourth  news bulletin!

This week has been another big one with many papers featuring TESS data published on the archive, as such we have chosen to focus on just a few, but well done to everyone again this week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10394"&gt;The Pre-He White Dwarfs in Eclipsing Binaries. I. WASP 0131+28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Lee et al., 2020)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
TESS archival data in combination with that from WASP were used to construct detailed light curves and spectra for the post-mass transfer binary star WASP 0131+28, an EL CVn eclipsing binary in a thin disk. These data were used to study the properties of the extremely low mass white dwarfs. Spectra were used to derive an effective temperature of T&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; = 10,000K, and radial velocities  of &amp;#120011;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;sin&amp;#119998; = 55 km. The TESS data were used to obtain accurate fundamental parameters. The mass of the secondary was derived as 0.2 M&amp;#8857;, with a radius of 0.528 R&amp;#8857;, T&lt;sub&gt;eff,2&lt;/sub&gt; of 11,186 K, and L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of 3.9 L&amp;#8857;. The parameters derived agree well with the evolutionary sequence for a He-core white dwarf of mass 0.203 M&amp;#8857;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10281"&gt;10 Years of Stellar Activity for GJ 1243&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Davenport et al., 2020)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
GJ 1243 is a flaring M4 dwarf and has been used for studying stellar flare and star spot activity. Data from the Kepler mission was used in the past to study this object, but now new TESS data has been utilized to obtain precise stellar activity characterization for this object over more than a decade. Within the TESS 2-minute cadenced data 133 flare events were detected. These events were used to determine that the flare activity is unchanged between the Kepler and TESS epochs.  Star spots were also found to be consistent between the two data sets, indicating that this object does not show signs of solar-like activity cycles over 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10253"&gt;PTFO 8-8695: Two Stars, Two Signals, No Planet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Bouma et al 2002)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
This paper examines the signal from PTFO 8-8695 a star in the 7-10 million year old Orion-OB1 cluster. The star presents dips in its light curve similar to planetary transits, but previous evidence against a planet has been put forth. Using TESS and Gaia data the authors re-examine this object. TESS data indicate two photometric periods, one at 11.98 hrs thought to be caused by stellar rotation, the other at 10.76 hrs and possessing a signal similar to that for planetary transits. It is difficult to interpret the dips as planetary based since their  phase is nearly 180&amp;#176; away from the phase of the originally reported dips. The paper goes on to  considers PTFO 8-8695 as a pair of young and rapidly rotating M dwarfs, one of which is causing the  “transient-dipper” behavior that has been seen in a newly emerging transient class of stars. The physical origin of the dips is still unknown, but likely due to  circumstellar material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09187"&gt;The Pulsation Properties of &amp;#955; Bootis Stars I. The Southern TESS Sample&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Murphy et al., 2020)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
This paper uses TESS data/light-curves to analyzes a sample of 70 Southern Hemisphere &amp;#955; Bootis Stars. From these data the authors identify binaries and determine which of the targets pulsate as &amp;#948; Scuti stars.  Four objects were discovered to be binaries, two heartbeat and two eclipsing. In total 81% of the sample examined pulsate as 948 Scuti stars, this is twice that of normal starts over the same parameter space. Of the &amp;#955; Bootis Stars examined 40 have TESS 2min cadence data, this was used to determining  the temperatures, luminosities and &amp;#948; Scutii variability of the targets . &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

With in this paper the authors use their DiffeRencial flUx Method of cuTting Off biNariES (DRUM TONES) algorithm to measure the stellar rotation in eclipsing binaries or planetary systems. There are many complications to such a task including disentangling the signal from the stellar rotation from the transit signal of a stellar or sub-stellar companion. The authors apply their method to TESS data as well as that from other missions. Their method shows a good agreement in the determination of stellar rotation periods for the few observed targets.&lt;/p&gt;

A convolutional neural network (CNN) called &lt;em&gt;Stella&lt;/em&gt; has been trained to find flares in TESS short cadenced data. The CNN was applied to 3200 young stars to evaluate flare rates as a function of age and spectral type. The rotation periods for 1500 targets were also measured and it was found that flares of all amplitudes are present across all spot phases, and as such that the spot coverage is high across the entire surface. The study also examines the flare rates and amplitudes across all stellar ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

The paper examines V453 Cyg, an eclipsing binary which contains two stars of mass 14 and 11 M&amp;#8857;, in an eccentric short period orbit. &amp;#946; Cep type pulsations were discovered within this system, with 7 significant pulses between 2.37 and 10.51 days&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in the primary. Using TESS data and spectroscopic results the physical properties of the stars were derived to a high precision.&lt;/p&gt;

This paper addresses the study of astroseismology with TESS and the need for strong timing requirements. The paper studies the potential consistent drift of TESS in its time keeping and the need for calibration or offsets. A simultaneous study of ground- and space-based primary eclipses of several binary streams in the Southern ecliptic Hemisphere was conducted to verify the reliability of the TESS time stamps. The TESS Barycentric time is 5.8 sec too fast, but consistent with zero at the 2.3 sigma level. The authors also test the existence of a drift with a monotonic growth/decay affecting the observations of all stars.  A drift corresponding to sigma_drift = 0.009 sec/day was determined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07086"&gt;A possible transit of a disintegrating exoplanet in the nearby multiplanet system DMPP-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;em&gt;(Jones et al., 2020)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
TESS photometry of DMPP-1 is analyzed within this paper. This star is  an F8V type and host to hot super Earths and warm Neptunes. A transiting period of 3.29 days is determined with a depth of 87 ppm, shallower than all pervious TESS discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06841"&gt;Periodicity search for Pulsar Binaries with TESS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Pal et al.,m 2020)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
The TESS data set is used to periodically search for pulsar binary candidates via observation of the flux variation thought to come mainly from the stellar companion. From the TESS data the authors look for flux modulation in five pulsar binaries with reported orbital periods, these include  PSR J1023+0038, 3FGL J0523.3-2528, 3FGL J0212.1+5320, 3FGL J0744.1-2523 and PSR J1417-4402. The paper demonstrates how useful TESS data is in identifying the periodicities of redback-like systems. ~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2226-8"&gt;Very regular high-frequency pulsation modes in young intermediate-mass stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Bedding et al., 2020)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
Some stars can experience pulsations which can be used to probe their internal structure. Such a class of stars are &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Scuti_variable"&gt;Delta Scuti&lt;/a&gt; stars, which are of intermediate mass and pulsate in interesting and complex ways. Understanding the nature of these pulsations can be extremely difficult, but using the large FoV, and high cadence coverage provided by TESS scientists were able to detect a subset of Delta Scuti stars with regular pulsations. Once these patterns were established the scientists continued their investigation using data from Kepler, and conducted follow up observations using ground-based facilities such as &lt;a href="http://www.keckobservatory.org"&gt;Keck&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://lco.global"&gt;Las Cumbres Observatory&lt;/a&gt;. The detection of clear patterns in these  objects  is significant as now these pulsations can be compared to models and our understanding of these objects improved. For more information  about this  significant discovery please visit the &lt;a href="https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/news/1645/nasas-tess-enables-breakthrough-study-of-perplexing-stellar-pulsations/"&gt;NASA feature webpage&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05153"&gt;An Unusual Transmission Spectrum for the Sub-Saturn KELT-11b Suggestive of a Sub-Solar Water Abundance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Colon et al., 2020)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
This paper  presents a detailed glimpse into  the atmospheric properties  of KELT-11b, an inflated  sub-Saturn-mass  planet. Data used in the presented  analysis were from several space-based telescopes including  TESS, &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/main/index.html"&gt;HST&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/spitzer/main/index.html"&gt;Spitzer&lt;/a&gt;. Major findings  of the paper include a low-amplitude water feature and extremely low  metallicity, both  unusual  features for this planet which challenge atmosphere and formation models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04491"&gt;Optical Variability of the Dwarf AGN NGC 4395 from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Burke et al.,  2020)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
TESS  is  used to create  light-curves of the dwarf AGN in the nearby galaxy NGC 4395. This galaxy hosts a ~10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; M&amp;#8857; supermassive black hole. Variability is detected on timescales from weeks to hours before reaching the  background noise level. The TESS light-curve can be well fit by a simple dampened random walk model with a dampening time-scale of 2.3 days. The periodogram can be fit with a high frequency slope of -1.88, and a break frequency consistent with the dampening time-scale. The paper uses NGC 4395 to illustrate the fact that TESS data can be used for extragalactic science.&lt;/p&gt;

TESS observations are used in comparison to simultaneous observations from the ground-based &lt;a href="https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/speculoos/"&gt;SPECULOOS-South telescopes&lt;/a&gt; to  test the level of precision obtained via the author's automatic pipeline. SPECULOOS is surveying for transiting  terrestrial planets around the nearest and brightest ultra-cool dwarf stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome TESS followers! We here in the TESS GI office plan to issue weekly news bulletins to keep you informed of all things TESS related and to also highlight your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below we highlight four papers that were posted to arXiv.org in the last week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01684"&gt;Original Research By Young Twinkle Students (ORBYTS): Ephemeris Refinement of Transiting Exoplanets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Edwards et al., 2020)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
Eight planets are studied in detail and their ephemeris and orbital data are refined. Data used are that from TESS and fully robotic ground-based telescope network. For seven of the planets the authors find that the observed transit time was outside of the predicted uncertainties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00272"&gt;TESS Asteroseismic Analysis of the Known Exoplanet Host Star HD 222076&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Jiang et al., 2020)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
Using TESS data the paper presents an asteroseismic analysis of the red giant star HD 222076 (discovered by &lt;a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/153/2/51/pdf"&gt;Wittenmyer et al 2017&lt;/a&gt;) which has a long period giant planet that was discovered via radial velocity measurements. Asteroseismic modeling has determined the mass of the star as 1.12 M&amp;#8857;, with a radius of 4.34 R&amp;#8857;, and an age of 7.4 Gyr. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00013"&gt;TESS Hunt for Young and Maturing Exoplanets (THYME) II: A 17 Myr Old Transiting Hot Jupiter in the Sco-Cen Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Rizzuto et al., 2020)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
A 17Myr old transiting hot Jupiter was discovered around HIP 67522, a 10-20 Myr old Sco-CenO OB  star. The orbital period of the planet was identified as 6.96 days with a radius of 10.02 R&amp;#8853;. An additional planet candidate was also identified with an orbital period of ~23 days and a radius of ~8 R&amp;#8853;. The hot Jupiter HIP 67522b is the youngest confirmed transiting hot Jupiter-sized planet discovered to date.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00047"&gt;TESS Hunt for Young and Maturing Exoplanets (THYME) III: a two-planet system in the 400 Myr Ursa Major Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Mann et al., 2020)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;
This paper presents the discovery of two planets orbiting a young Sun-like star (M = 0.99&amp;#8857;) HD 63433. HD 63433 was determined to be part of the 414 Myr old Ursa Major moving  group.  The planets have  radii of 2.15R&amp;#8853;, and 2.67R&amp;#8853; respectively, with orbital periods of 7.11 and 20.55 days. The system is important as it will aid our understanding of planetary system evolution in the first billion years after formation.&lt;/p&gt;

Since launching on April 18, 2018, TESS has mapped out a significant fraction of the night sky, confirmed the existence of 45 exoplanets, found more than 1700 planet candidates, and been used to examine the variability of countless sources such as active galactic nuclei and supernovae. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before science operations even began in July 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2018/nasa-s-planet-hunting-tess-catches-a-comet-before-starting-science"&gt;TESS managed to capture a set of images showing the motion of the comet C/2018N1&lt;/a&gt;, illustrating TESS's unique ability to collect a set of stable periodic images covering a wide region of the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the first few months of operation, TESS demonstrated its planet hunting abilities by detecting its &lt;a href="https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/news/1542/nasas-tess-rounds-up-its-first-planets-snares-far-flung-supernovae/"&gt;first three exoplanets&lt;/a&gt;: a planet named Pi Mensae c, which is twice the size of the Earth and orbits its Sun like star every six days; LHS 3844 b, a rocky planet located in the constellation Indus, at a distance of only 49 light years; a dense non-rocky planet named HD 21749 b, which is three times the size of the Earth and 23 times more massive, making the planet more dense than Neptune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2020/nasa-planet-hunter-finds-its-1st-earth-size-habitable-zone-world/"&gt;TESS discovered its first Earth-size planet in the habitable zone&lt;/a&gt;, which was announced in early 2020. The planet named TOI 700 d orbits a cool M dwarf star approximately 40% the mass and size of the Sun and is just over 100 light years away in the southern constellation of Draco. To date TOI 700 d is one of only a few planets discovered within a system’s habitable zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2020/nasa-s-tess-mission-uncovers-its-1st-world-with-two-stars"&gt;TESS also detected its first circumbinary planetary system in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. The planet, TOI 1338 b, is a world that orbits two stars in the constellation of Pictor, at a distance of 1300 light years. The two stars orbit each other every 15 days - one is 10% more massive than the Sun whilst the other is cooler and dimmer at 1/3 the size of the Sun. TOI 1338 b is believed to be the only planet in the system and is almost 7 times larger than the Earth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from hunting for planets, TESS, with its almost all-sky survey capability and high-cadenced observations, is a great tool to study the variable universe. &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/nasa-s-tess-mission-spots-its-1st-star-shredding-black-hole/"&gt;TESS watched a star being torn apart by a black hole in a phenomenon known as a tidal disruption event (TDE)&lt;/a&gt;. This event was named ASASSN-19bt as it was first identified by the ground-based All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae. The data provided by TESS allowed the astronomical community to view the light from the event much closer to the black hole than ever before!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TESS has also been used to create detailed high-cadenced light curves of supernovae (SNe). &lt;a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190402171F/abstract"&gt;Recent work presented 18 early time light curves of Type Ia SNe occurring in the first six sectors of TESS data&lt;/a&gt;. SN Ia are one of our most mature cosmological probes, however we still do not have a firm understanding of the progenitor systems. The detailed early time observations of these transient events by TESS are extremely important and can provide vital information in understanding these systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The science highlighted here represents only a small amount of the incredible science to have come out of the TESS prime mission to date, thanks to efforts of both the TESS mission team and the TESS community. So what is next for TESS? The two-year prime mission will end in July 2020, and given the success of TESS, the mission has now been extended for a further two years through October 2022. TESS will remain as NASA's key planet hunter, but it will also continue to provide the high-quality wide-field survey data required for the exploration of many different kinds of variable and transient events in the night sky -- part of which is shown below in the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/nasa-s-tess-presents-panorama-of-southern-sky/"&gt;mosaic of the southern sky as seen by TESS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt; Monday, January 6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Splinter Session 5:30 pm - 7:00 pm (Room 306AB) &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; NASA's TESS Mission- Exoplanets, Time Domain Astronomy and Astrophysics from the Prime Mission, and Extended Mission Preview &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA’s TESS mission launched in 2018, is now well more than halfway through its prime science program, surveying most of the sky, searching for transiting exoplanets orbiting bright, nearby stars. The team has identified well over one thousand promising planet candidates, and an active follow-up program has led to the confirmation of dozens of planets. While the main science goal is measuring the masses of fifty planets smaller than 4 Earth radii, the high-precision long-timeline, high-cadence photometry provided by the TESS cameras allows a wealth of additional astrophysics investigations. A robust Guest Investigator Program complements the exoplanet investigation underway by the TESS Science Team. This splinter session will present mission status, early science results, and future plans for the TESS extended mission, which begins in July 2020. Come join TESS project staff, who will be on hand to answer questions and chat in the informal reception to follow a few brief talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt; Wednesday, January 8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special Session 2:00 pm - 3:30 pm (Room 323B) &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; 445. TESS and the Mass/Radius Diagram for Exoplanets &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A striking result from the Kepler mission is that the population of planets orbiting solar-type stars is dominated by planets smaller than 4 Earth radii, with a dip in the occurrence rate near 1.8 Earth Radii, often referred to as the radius gap. Are the planets below the gap rocky like the Earth, while the ones above the gap are more like Neptune? One of the primary goals of the TESS mission is to determine masses and radii for at least 50 planets smaller than 4 Earth radii, thus providing bulk densities and surface gravities needed to address this issue. In this Special Session we will highlight the progress towards this goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

and the information available on our website regarding &lt;a href="proposing-investigations.html"&gt;proposing investigations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We remind proposers that in Cycle 3, two new observing modes will potentially be
available and collected at &lt;a href="proposing-investigations.html#shared-risk-science"&gt;"shared risk"&lt;/a&gt;: 10-minute cadence full-frame images and 20-second
cadence postage stamps. A 2-minute cadence mode will also be available
as in previous cycles. There is also a new Key Project proposal
category, and ground-based observing focused programs are also
solicited. We also emphasize that in the extended mission, all postage stamp targets will be
selected via this Guest Investigator Program or via the &lt;a href="proposing-investigations.html#directors-discretionary-targets"&gt;Director's
Discretionary Targets Program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TESS Cycle 3 observations will be collected during the first year of the extended mission,
running from July 2020 until June 2021. All Cycle 3 fields are in the
Southern Ecliptic Hemisphere. The
&lt;a href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/tess/webtess/wtv.py"&gt;Web TESS Viewing Tool&lt;/a&gt;
has been updated to include the Cycle 3 pointings, so that proposers
can determine when a target is expected to be observed by TESS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposers may also be interested in the templates we have created to
assist in putting together a proposal. &lt;a href="proposing-investigations.html#proposal-templates"&gt;The templates can be found on
our website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposers requesting short-cadence target slots (either 20-second or
2-minute cadence) need to submit a target list along with the
proposal. Information on &lt;a href="proposing-investigations.html#target-table"&gt;how to create a target table&lt;/a&gt; can be found on
our website, which also includes a link to a tutorial provided by the MAST.&lt;/p&gt;

Changes include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new 20-second cadence mode will potentially be available. Once
commissioned, approximately 1,000 target slots per sector will be
available in this mode. Guest Investigator (GI) observations in this
mode will be collected at &lt;a href="proposing-investigations.html#shared-risk-science"&gt;"shared risk"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 10-fold increase in the number of 2-minute cadence targets is
available to the GI program. More than 15,000 target slots will be
available in each sector; a total of approximately 200,000 target
slots are available in Cycle 3, facilitating very large GI programs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The full-frame image cadence is planned to be reduced from 30
minutes to 10 minutes. This change in cadence will be considered
a "shared risk"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new Key Project proposal category is available. These programs
have a maximum duration of 27 months. The programs may be
continued into TESS Cycle 4 and may propose to select targets in
both Cycles 3 and 4 (although only Cycle 3 target lists are solicited
at this time)&lt;/li&gt;

As part of this extended mission, Guest Investigator proposals will continue to be solicited as part of Cycles 3 and 4. As in the prime mission, Guest Investigators will be able to propose to collect 2-minute cadence data for a select number of targets or request funds to analyze full-frame image data. Two major changes in the extended mission are that a new 20-second cadence mode will be available for observations, and the cadence of full-frame images will change from 30-minutes to 10-minutes. Stay tuned for additional details to be posted on our website and in the Cycle 3 call for proposals, which will be released soon. &lt;a href="https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/2019-senior-review-operating-missions/"&gt;Reports from the 2019 NASA Senior Review of Operating Missions can be found here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="news"></category></entry><entry><title>Update on pointing for Sector 16</title><link href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/update-on-pointing-for-sector-16.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-09-02T13:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-09-02T13:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Knicole Colon</name></author><id>tag:heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov,2019-09-02:/docs/tess/update-on-pointing-for-sector-16.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;TESS has been successfully conducting observations in the northern ecliptic hemisphere since July 18th. As previously announced, the field-of-view of the TESS camera array was shifted north by 31° with respect to its nominal pointing in Sectors 14 and 15 in order to reduce the impact of scattered light from …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;TESS has been successfully conducting observations in the northern ecliptic hemisphere since July 18th. As previously announced, the field-of-view of the TESS camera array was shifted north by 31° with respect to its nominal pointing in Sectors 14 and 15 in order to reduce the impact of scattered light from the Earth and Moon. After examining Sector 14 data, it has been decided that the pointing for Sector 16 will also be shifted.&lt;/p&gt;

The cameras will be oriented along a line of ecliptic longitude (as they were in Year 1), with that longitude determined by the anti-solar longitude at the mid-point of the sector. For most of Year 2, the camera array will be oriented such that Camera 4 is centered on the northern ecliptic pole: in this orientation, the southernmost edge of Camera 1 is ~6° from the ecliptic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, for Sectors 14 and 15, scattered light from the Earth and Moon is predicted to be a significant problem in Cameras 1 and 2, reducing the available observing time for exoplanet transits by as much as 75% in those cameras. To reduce the impact of scattered light, the field-of-view of the camera array will be shifted north by 31° with respect to its nominal pointing in Sectors 14 and 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the cameras are shifted north, the northern ecliptic pole will be located 7° from the center of camera 3, and the southernmost edge of Camera 1 will be at an ecliptic latitude of ~37°.  In addition, with this shift, the fields-of-view of Cameras 3 and 4 will be observing “on the other side of the pole”, thereby providing additional observations of parts of the sky that would otherwise only be observed in Sectors 20-22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scattered light from the Earth and Moon is also expected to be a problem in Sectors 25 and 26 and, to a lesser extent, in Sectors 16 and 24.  The scattered light performance in Sectors 14 and 15 will be reviewed before deciding the instrument pointing in these later sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sky coverage maps for Sectors 1-21 are given below in the ecliptic and celestial coordinate systems.  Two sets of maps are shown below: the upper pair is the sky coverage if Sector 16 is observed at the nominal camera orientation, while the lower pair is the sky coverage if Sector 16 is shifted north.&lt;/p&gt;

on TESS science, and it is not too late to register for them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is the TASC5/KASC12 workshop, being held in Cambridge, MA
from July 22-26. TASC5/KASC12 will be the first meeting where participants have
the opportunity to present analysis and results from asteroseismology
and precision stellar astrophysics of objects in the southern ecliptic
observed by TESS. The workshop will emphasize the most recent results
from TESS, but will also highlight new results from existing data from
the Kepler and K2 missions; the joint meeting is the 5th workshop of
the TESS Asteroseismic Science Consortium and the 12th workshop of the
Kepler Asteroseismic Science Consortium. &lt;a href="http://web.mit.edu/tasc5/index.html"&gt;Additional details about the meeting can be found at its website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second is the TESS Science Conference I, being held in
Cambridge, MA from July 29-August 2. The TESS Science Conference I
will be the first conference dedicated to TESS mission science,
including exoplanets, asteroseismology, stellar binaries, variable
stars, Solar System science (e.g., asteroids and comets),
extragalactic astronomy (e.g., active galactic nuclei and supernovae),
and any other science that can be done with TESS data. The conference
will cover all aspects of the mission, from TESS data analysis,
through follow-up observations, to the impact of discoveries made with
TESS data on theoretical understanding. &lt;a href="https://tsc.mit.edu/"&gt;Additional details about the meeting can be found at its website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third conference relevant to TESS that is happening later this year from November 4-8 at NASA's Goddard Space
Flight Center is Rocky Exoplanets in the Era of JWST: Theory and
Observation. With its large primary mirror and complement of IR
instrumentation, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is poised to
dramatically expand our view of the environments of rocky
exoplanets. JWST will be further aided by the discovery of a new crop
of small planets orbiting nearby low-mass stars and brown dwarfs from
the TESS mission and ground-based surveys, enabling higher precision
measurements over a wider population of potentially rocky worlds. With
these exciting opportunities on the horizon, now is the time to
improve our understanding of what information can be gleaned about
rocky worlds from these future measurements, based on our
understanding of the observations themselves as well as detailed
modeling of the planetary environments that will be
examined. &lt;a href="https://seec.gsfc.nasa.gov/Symposium.html"&gt;Pre-registration is now open at the meeting website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="news"></category></entry><entry><title>Guest Investigator Program Cycle 2 results available</title><link href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/guest-investigator-program-cycle-2-results-available.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-06-21T10:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-06-21T10:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Knicole Colon</name></author><id>tag:heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov,2019-06-21:/docs/tess/guest-investigator-program-cycle-2-results-available.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The selection of TESS Guest Investigator Program Cycle 2 proposals has been finalized.

TESS is currently collecting 2-minute cadence and 30-minute cadence full frame image science data from Observation Sector 5 in the Southern ecliptic hemisphere. Data from the first four Observation Sectors have been received on the ground and have been or are being processed through the pipeline. The TESS Science Office has been vetting planet candidates, and has begun issuing public Alerts on a select set of especially promising TESS candidates, that are also being followed up with ground-based telescopes to confirm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is anticipated that the full data set from Observation Sectors 1 and 2 will be released publicly via the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) in early December 2018. This release will be accompanied by a draft version of the instrument handbook and release notes for each sector. The TESS Data Release Notes will include data quality diagnostics and information about data and instrument characteristics. The full data set from Sectors 3 and 4 will be released no later than January 25, 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several services will be available to support the community with this early release of data. A summary of those services that will be available at the MAST for TESS data download of the first two TESS Sectors &lt;a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/tess/summary.html"&gt;is available&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, the MAST will provide an archive manual that will describe an overview of the TESS data products as well as instructions on how to download them.  The manual contains tutorials and python notebooks that walk through how to use the MAST Portal, exo.MAST and Astroquery to retrieve data for scientifically interesting use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/"&gt;TESS Science Support Center&lt;/a&gt; maintains a list of approved &lt;a href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/approved-programs.html"&gt;Guest Investigator (GI) programs&lt;/a&gt; and their associated targets that are or will be observed at 2-minute cadence in Cycle 1. The observed GI targets lists are also available for individual sectors. The TESS Science Support Center will provide links to additional tools and tutorials that can be used for analysis of TESS 2-minute cadence Target Pixel Files and 30-minute cadence Full Frame Images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deadline to submit proposals for TESS GI Cycle 2 is February 28, 2019. Cycle 2 covers targets in the Northern ecliptic hemisphere. Further information about the proposal process, proposal tools, and permitted science areas can be found on the TESS Science Support Center website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://tess.mit.edu/"&gt;TESS website at MIT&lt;/a&gt; contains information regarding the current schedule of observations. Information on how to submit proposals for Director’s Discretionary Targets to be observed at 2-minute cadence in future sectors can also be found at &lt;a href="https://tess.mit.edu/science/ddt/"&gt;the MIT site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The TESS data are being passed through the mission data pipeline at NASA’s Ames Research Center, referred to as the Science Processing Operations Center (SPOC). The science team has begun sifting through the data, searching for signals that look like promising candidate planets, that they plan to follow up using ground-based and space-based telescopes to confirm. The team began beta-testing the process by which the community is notified of these promising TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs) on September 5th. Announcements of compelling planet candidates have been submitted to preprint servers and await peer review and acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a careful quality check and review of the results by the TESS team, the data for the majority of the Alerts from Sector 1 were deemed ready to share with the broader scientific community. &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/tess-data-alerts/"&gt;MAST are hosting the SPOC Target Pixel Files, as well as the light curves and DV reports for those Alerts&lt;/a&gt; for which two-minute cadence data were collected.

TESS is now pointed at the sky location for the second observation sector of the science survey, and will make a close approach to the Earth and download the first half of data from sector 2 this week. Meanwhile, the Sector 1 data are being passed through data analysis pipelines and the science team has begun sifting through the data, searching for signals that look like promising candidate planets. The TESS team has reported that the mission data have revealed dozens of exciting candidates that they plan to follow up using powerful ground-based telescopes to confirm. The team has begun beta-testing the process by which the community will be notified of these promising "TESS Object of Interest" (TOIs), with the goal of issuing fully public TOI Alerts in the next few months. The selected beta testers include professional and amateur astronomers who will contribute to the TESS exoplanet follow-up process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every new mission goes through a period of data validation and verification before beginning delivery of the final data to a public archive. This serves to test how the pipelines are performing on actual flight data from the mission, and determines whether any changes need to be made before the data are fully prepared for delivery to the archive. In the case of the TESS mission, once the data are delivered to the Mikulski Archive at Space Telescope (MAST) in Baltimore, they will be immediately available to anyone. The first delivery of TESS data to MAST is expected to occur no later than six months from the start of science observations, and will include all data from the first 4 27-day observations sectors. TOI Alerts will allow the broader astrophysics community, and the general public, to follow along with TESS’s most exciting discoveries, even before the first data are available in the MAST archive.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="news"></category></entry><entry><title>Sector 2 GI target list available</title><link href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/sector-2-gi-target-list-available.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-08-27T08:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-08-27T08:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Tom Barclay</name></author><id>tag:heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov,2018-08-27:/docs/tess/sector-2-gi-target-list-available.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;TESS Sector 2 began last week.

&lt;p&gt;While in the final science orbit, TESS, like anybody in a three-body system with little station keeping, goes through &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kozai_mechanism"&gt;Kozai cycles&lt;/a&gt;. TESS will primarily undergo tho periodic oscillations, one on a 10 month cycle, and another with a 10 year cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what does this mean? Well, the orbital period is not constant, neither is the inclination, eccentricity or any of the other orbital parameters. The orbital period ranges from about 12.8 to 14.6 days, with an average of 13.65 days. Furthermore, between now and 2020, the perigee distance will range from about 10 to 20 earth-radii.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure below nicely illustrates Kozai cycles influencing the argument of perigee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simulated data, called ETE-6 (End-To-End 6) was created by TESS team members from NASA Ames and MIT to test the TESS ground system. This synthetic data contains 1 sector (slightly longer than two orbits) of TESS data and is meant to reflect what the archival data products will look like when produced for actual flight data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ETE-6 includes samples of the following data products:
Uncalibrated FFI's
Calibrated FFI's 
Extracted Light Curves (The simulated 2-min cadence data consist of 20,610 cadences)
Target Pixel Files
Data Validation Files 
Cotrending Basis Vectors 
Collateral Target Pixel Files
Models (Huffman tables, Mean Black table, flat-field, read-noise, linearity, gain, etc.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data inlude injected signals to mimic transiting planets, eclipsing binaries, and stellar variability in 15,000 target stars selected for 2-minute cadence observations. Note these injected signals were designed to test the sensitivity of the NASA Ames planet search pipeline and does not represent what is expected in the actual data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/tess/ete-6/ETE-6_README.pdf"&gt;README&lt;/a&gt; file is available at MAST and contains information on how these products were created and their caveats.

Grants will be released when data is publicly available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The over-subscription factor for this program was extremely high (4.5). Many highly rated programs were not able to be selected for funding. However, we have good news. All full-frame-image data will be released publicly with no exclusive use period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we anticipate that the number of executed 2-minute cadence target programs will significantly exceed the number that we were able to fund. Therefore, even though a particular program may not have been selected for funding there is still a good chance that it will be either partially for full executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We anticipate that target lists for the first sector to be available within a few weeks of launch.

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TESS Guest Investigator Cycle 1 is awarding targets in the Southern Ecliptic Hemisphere. Northern Ecliptic targets will be solicited in Cycle 2. Including targets that can't be observed won't technically impact your proposal - we will just remove them - but it may suggest to reviewers that you haven't done your homework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your target lists should be in priority order. We many choose to award less than the full proposed target list; providing your targets in ranked order enables us to do this. For proposals with very large target lists, we recommend mentioning in the proposal the minimum number of target required to accomplish the scientific goals.&lt;/p&gt;

As a result of these discussions the mission is committing to observing at two-minute cadence all stars that fall into the TESS field of view that are (a) brighter than 6th magnitude in the TESS bandpass, and (b) but are not too bright that their saturation bleed cannot be captured fully with a pixel mask. For Cycle-1 this accounts for approximately 6,000 stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have made a slight modification to the &lt;a href="data/core-science-targets-v2.csv"&gt;list of targets&lt;/a&gt; that should not be included in TESS Cycle 1 GI proposals to search for transiting exoplanets using two-minute cadence data. This list now includes these 6,000 bright stars. This change is unlikely to significantly impact any proposals because these the majority of these bright stars are large (M-giants, B-stars, etc.). This makes detecting transiting planets challenging, and the detectability is unlikely to be improved with two-minute cadence over the full-frame image data.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="news"></category></entry><entry><title>TESS-HERMES catalog of spectroscopic stellar parameters is now available</title><link href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/tess-hermes-catalog-of-spectroscopic-stellar-parameters-is-now-available.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-08-24T13:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-08-24T13:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Elisa Quintana</name></author><id>tag:heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov,2017-08-24:/docs/tess/tess-hermes-catalog-of-spectroscopic-stellar-parameters-is-now-available.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A catalog of spectroscopic stellar parameters for stars in the TESS southern continuous viewing zone (CVZ) is now available and may prove a useful resource for &lt;a href="proposing-investigations.html"&gt;TESS GI proposal preparation&lt;/a&gt;.

Data taken by the High Efficiency and Resolution Multi-Element Spectrograph (HERMES) at the Anglo-Australian Telescope, as part of the TESS-HERMES survey, provides temperature, surface gravity, and metalicity for about 16,000 dwarf and subgiant stars with magnitudes 10&amp;lt;V&amp;lt;13.1, along with Bayesian estimates of stellar properties (distance, extinction, mass, radius, and age) using theoretical isochrones. Stellar surface gravity and radius are made available for an additional set of roughly 8,500 red giants.

&lt;p&gt;Now that TESS has completed this critical review, the mission's cameras and science data processing computer are scheduled to begin installation onto the spacecraft at Orbital ATK in Dulles, Virginia, over the next several weeks. Once successfully integrated, the spacecraft will spend the rest of the year undergoing rigorous testing to ensure the mission can withstand the harsh environment of space. The spacecraft is scheduled to ship in February to NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida for launch aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the Kepler telescope, by design there is a range of focus and image quality across the TESS camera's field of view. Recent measurements revealed the TESS cameras to have slightly reduced focus and image quality near the outer edge of the image when placed in the cold temperatures of space, and better camera focus and image quality towards the center of the image. The difference between the designed and measured focus and image quality will not affect the mission's science goals.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="news"></category></entry><entry><title>Error in a small number of TIC v5 surface gravities</title><link href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/error-in-a-small-number-of-tic-v5-surface-gravities.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-08-01T14:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-08-01T14:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Tom Barclay</name></author><id>tag:heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov,2017-08-01:/docs/tess/error-in-a-small-number-of-tic-v5-surface-gravities.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The surface gravities reported in column 67 of the TESS Input Catalog version 5 (TIC-5), do not accurately represent the expected surface gravities using the reported values for mass (column 73) and radii (column 71).

In a 2-year, near all-sky survey, TESS will monitor the brightness of nearby, bright F, G, K, and M stars in order to photometrically search for transiting planets smaller than Neptune. TESS will monitor the brightness of more than 200,000 stars spread over the celestial sphere with a photometric sensitivity sufficient to permit detection of transiting planets with radii less than 2.5 Earth radii. The mission’s high-precision, continuous baseline photometric capability is also well suited for variability and asteroseismology research and analyses of both Galactic and extragalactic astrophysical sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observations associated with the TESS Guest Investigator (GI) Cycle 1 solicitation will begin immediately following the successful ~60-day scientific commissioning of the spacecraft. Proposals submitted to this program should be for new science investigations of the southern ecliptic hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase-1 proposals are due by 4:30 pm Eastern time on September 29, 2017&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="news"></category></entry><entry><title>TESS Science Support Center at KepSciCon</title><link href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/tess-science-support-center-at-kepscicon.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-06-16T10:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-06-16T10:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Tom Barclay</name></author><id>tag:heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov,2017-06-16:/docs/tess/tess-science-support-center-at-kepscicon.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We will be hosting a breakout session at the Kepler Science Conference, at NASA Ames, CA.

Our first cycle deadline will be on September 29, 2017, with the in-person peer review likely taking place in mid-December. We are currently looking for volunteers with expertise in astrophysics and exoplanet science to serve on our review panel. The requirements are that you have a PhD or relevant experience (so this opportunity isn't open to graduate students), and that you are not intending to PI a TESS Cycle 1 proposal (it's fine if you later choose to submit a proposal, but we would then not invite you to the review). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please get in touch by sending your name, institution, and areas of expertise to &lt;a href="mailto:tessgi@bigbang.gsfc.nasa.gov"&gt;tessgi@bigbang.gsfc.nasa.gov&lt;/a&gt;, or filling in &lt;a href="https://goo.gl/forms/p4ZqiTQSEHjbM6nz2"&gt;this form&lt;/a&gt;. As a guide, we are anticipating having panels made up of an approximately 50/50 split between postdocs and more senior scientists. Topics we are particularly interested in recruiting reviewers for are exoplanet science, asteroseismology, stellar activity, binary stars, and supernova observations. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="news"></category></entry><entry><title>Tell us about the software tool and data products you would like</title><link href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/tell-us-about-the-software-tool-and-data-products-you-would-like.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-04-21T14:01:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-04-21T14:01:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Tom Barclay</name></author><id>tag:heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov,2017-04-21:/docs/tess/tell-us-about-the-software-tool-and-data-products-you-would-like.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The TESS Science Support Center at NASA Goddard is currently collecting input from the scientific community on what tools and data products you would like to see developed.
