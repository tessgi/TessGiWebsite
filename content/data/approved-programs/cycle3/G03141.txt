Title: Confirming And Characterizing Young Exoplanets

PI: Newton, Elisabeth - Dartmouth College

Type: SMALL

Summary: In order to piece together how the planetary evolution process occurs, we need to make detailed studies of the few young planets that are accessible to in-depth follow- up. We propose to make 2 min cadence observations of confirmed and candidate young planets identified in Cycle 1 in order to improve our knowledge of secure detections and confirm the most promising candidate signals.
