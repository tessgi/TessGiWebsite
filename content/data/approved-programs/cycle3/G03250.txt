Title: Legacy Light Curves Of A Volume-Complete Sample Of The Nearby Mid-To-Late M Dwarfs With TESS

PI: Winters, Jennifer - Harvard-Smithsonian Center For Astrophysics

Type: SMALL

Summary: M dwarfs account for 75% of all stars. The nearest M dwarfs are the most easily studied; moreover, for the coming decade, the only spectroscopically-accessible temperate, terrestrial worlds will be the ones that transit the closest mid-to-late M-dwarfs. Key stellar properties remain uncertain, notably their magnetic activity, rotation periods, and multiplicity. We propose to continue to gather TESS 2-minute cadence observations of the volume-complete sample of mid-to-late M dwarfs within 15 pc. Short cadence is essential to determine the flare morphologies, while continuing observations will reduce the uncertainties on our flare statistics. We will combine the TESS light curves with our ongoing high-res spectroscopic survey to yield a legacy dataset of our closest stellar neighbors.
