Title: The Search For Young Planets Using Combined Cycle 1 And Cycle 3 TESS Data.

PI: Mann, Andrew - University Of North Carolina

Type: SMALL

Summary: Planets are not born in their final state; their orbital and physical properties change as they interact with other planets and their greater environment. Young planets offer a window into these processes as well as a direct probe of the formation and evolution of planetary systems. However, the known sample of young transiting planets remains small, missing the smallest planets (proto-Earths) as well as those in the critical 50-150 Myr range. We propose an expanded search for young planets using Cycle 3 TESS data. Unlike earlier surveys, here we focus on the trove of marginal and unconfirmed detections from our Cycle 1 search, where additional TESS data is critical to distinguish stellar from planetary signals.
