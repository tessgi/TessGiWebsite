Title: The Search Additional Stellar Members And Young Transiting Worlds In The Ursa Major Moving Group

PI: Sheffler, Julia - University Of Wisconsin-Madison

Type: SMALL

Summary: The Ursa Major moving group (UMa) is the nearest (20pc), young stellar group (400Myr) and as a result is a critical test bed for planetary and stellar evolution at early timescales. Three planets, including a recently-discovered Earth-sized world, have already been confirmed in this moving group, adding to the small population (N=70) of known planets with ages younger than 500 Myr (age precision < 50%). Our team will identify and characterize additional UMa planets for which it is necessary to (a) build a complete catalog of UMa members, (b) precisely characterize their properties, and (c) perform continual exoplanet searches. TESS data will play a crucial role in this endeavor, significantly advancing our understanding of both the young stellar ensemble and its planetary systems.
