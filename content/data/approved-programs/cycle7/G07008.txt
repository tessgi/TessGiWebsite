Title: Exploring The Properties Spots On Young Stars

PI: Mann, Andrew - University Of North Carolina

Type: SMALL

Summary: Spots and similar features on stars can contaminate efforts to measure the masses, radii, and atmospheres of planetary systems. This is a particular problem for young stars, yet such systems are high-priority targets for JWST. Unfortunately, spot properties vary with age and stellar type, and we do not know what kind of complementary observations are required to extract spot properties. Here we propose a ground-based campaign simultaneous with TESS Cycle 7 observations of five young planet hosts. Our campaign will include observations over multiple rotation periods, which we will use to extract empirical spectra of the surface and spotted region of the star. We can then explore how reliably we can infer the stellar surface as a function of the data type and quality.
