Title: Searching For Type I (Thermonuclear) X-Ray Bursts With TESS

PI: Kashyap, Unnati - Texas Tech University

Type: SMALL

Summary: We request 20-second cadence data for 92 neutron stars accreting from low mass binary companions to search for thermonuclear bursts. These bursts start as X-ray flares of durations typically of about 10-100 seconds, and the X-rays then heat the outer parts of the accretion disks, and part of the X-ray emission is reprocessed into the optical band. The recurrence time of the bursts is set by the time it takes to accrete a pile that heats up enough to trigger CNO burning, and understanding the recurrence time as a function of accretion rate yields key information about nuclear physics. TESS's continuous coverage and wide field are necessary to estimate the recurrence times, which have been hard-to-impossible to measure over the 50 years in which these bursts have been observed to date.
