Title: The Empirical Mass-Radius Relation From 10 To 700 Myr

PI: Tofflemire, Benjamin - University Of Texas At Austin

Type: SMALL

Summary: Eclipsing binaries (EBs) provide benchmark measurements of stellar masses and radii that are the foundation of theoretical stellar astrophysics. Large areas of parameter space remain poorly constrained by observations, however, particularly at low masses and young ages. From the few sources that have been studied in this regime, models have been unable to simultaneously describe their observed properties (M, R, T, L). A thorough test of models requires a sample of EBs that spans both mass and age. TESS provides the first dataset capable of finding EBs on this scale. We therefore propose for targeted 2-m cadence observations of 40 young EB (10-700 Myr) discovered by our team in Cycle 2 and for 4157 young association members that will receive their first TESS observations in Cycle 4.
