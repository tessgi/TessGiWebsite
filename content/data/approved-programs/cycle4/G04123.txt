Title: Asteroseismology Of A And F Stars

PI: Antoci, Victoria - Danmarks Tekniske Universitet

Type: SMALL

Summary: TESS is the only instrument available that enables a systematic survey of bright pulsating A and F stars covering a large variety of evolutionary stages, rotation rates, chemical compositions and with strong and weak magnetic fields at an unprecedented precision. This proposal aims at continuing the TESS legacy sample of A and F stars that require the 2-min cadence. The new and old TESS data will be used to determine ages of young delta Sct stars, study the interaction of strong magnetic fields, atomic diffusion and suppression of convection in roAp stars, measure tidal forces in close binary systems by observing one-sided delta Sct stars, study atomic diffusion and pulsations in chemically peculiar Am/Fm stars and study the interactions between rapid rotation and pulsations.
