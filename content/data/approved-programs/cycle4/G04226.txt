Title: A Search For Companions To Lonely Hot Jupiters

PI: Hord, Benjamin - University Of Maryland (College Park)

Type: MINI

Summary: The formation of hot Jupiters (HJs) can be constrained by the existence of closely-orbiting small companions to HJs. Previous searches have found only three HJs with nearby companion planets, but only a fraction of every known HJ system has been observed at a short 2-minute cadence with the photometric precision of TESS. We propose to observe all Cycle 4 HJs with TESS's 2-minute cadence in a search for small nearby companions that could help constrain the formation mechanism of HJ systems and calculate the multiplicity rate of this unique planet population. This would generate the first complete and uniform data set of almost all HJ systems down to the precision of TESS, allowing for more detailed population analysis of this mysterious class of planets.
