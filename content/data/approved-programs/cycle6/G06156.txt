Title: Searching For Type I (Thermonuclear) X-Ray Bursts With TESS

PI: Kashyap, Unnati - Texas Tech University

Type: SMALL

Summary: We request 20-second cadence data for 33 neutron stars accreting from low mass binary companions to search for their thermonuclear bursts. These bursts start as X-ray flares of durations typically of about 10-100 seconds, and the X-rays then heat the outer parts of the accretion disks so part of their emission is reprocessed into the optical band. The recurrence time of the bursts is set by the time it takes to accrete a pile that heats up enough to trigger CNO burning, and understanding the recurrence time as a function of accretion rate yields key information about nuclear physics. TESS's continuous coverage and wide field are needed to estimate the recurrence times, which have been hard-to-impossible to measure over the 50 years in which these bursts have been observed to date.
