Title: Simultaneous TESS And Swift Observations Of Stellar Flares OnGJ1243 AndGJ1101

PI: Pietras, Malgorzata - Uniwersytet Wroclawski

Type: SMALL

Summary: GJ 1243 and GJ 1101 are very active M-type stars. Analysis of their optical light curves shows that we could expect on average about 1.5 flares per day and the presence of modulation caused by starspots. Visible, X-ray, and ultraviolet data from TESS and Swif would allow us to study the fundamental properties of emission processes and evaluate the main physical properties of the flaring plasma in stellar flares. We plan to investigate the main physical processes of the energy deposition regions in stellar flares. With such data, we will be able to understand the differences between solar flares and super-flares seen on other stars. In addition, our goal is to create a numerical model of stellar flares based on observations.
