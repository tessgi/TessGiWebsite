Title: TESS Cycle 6: Proposal For Observation Of Cataclysmic Variables

PI: Rucas, Tyler - University Of Texas At San Antonio

Type: SMALL

Summary: This TESS proposal focuses on eclipsing CVs because they provide the best laboratory for directly testing accretion behaviors in CVs of all sub-types. Using the 20-second cadence mode, this proposal argues for observations of several bright, eclipsing CVs visible to TESS during Cycle 6.
