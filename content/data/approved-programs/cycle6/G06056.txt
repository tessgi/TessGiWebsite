Title: Ground-Based Survey Planet Candidate Follow-Up With TESS

PI: Schanche, Nicole - NASA/GSFC & Umd

Type: MINI

Summary: Ground-based surveys were key drivers of early exoplanet discoveries. Hundreds of thousands of light curves have been produced from which candidate transit signals are identified. Using machine learning (ML), archival survey data has been scoured for missed transit signals. In previous sectors, TESS has observed the majority of the ML candidates, allowing for swift vetting of targets. Here, we seek to obtain additional 120-second observations for planet candidates for which 1) short-cadence observations are not available and 2) plausible transit signals from long-cadence FFI light curves have already been found. The shorter cadence will improve the transit model fits and provide improved radius measurements for the candidate planets.
