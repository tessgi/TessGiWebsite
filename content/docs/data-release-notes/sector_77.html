<tr>
  <td colspan="2" >Safe Hold:</td>
  <td colspan="5" >Sector 77 observations were truncated on April 6 because the on-board data recorder filled up due to a missed downlink on April 1. Observations did not resume until April 16 because the spacecraft was in Safe Hold mode. A total of 10.022 days of observations were lost due to these two events. No data are taken in Spacecraft Safe Hold mode, which is a configuration that prioritizes the safety of the spacecraft and instrument in response to anomalies. The temperatures of the cameras change slightly during safe holds, and users may find small shifts (â‰¤ 0.5 pixels) in the images for about 2 days after data collection resumes after a safe hold. These shifts are incorporated into the World Coordinate Solutions. Data collection was paused for a total of 10.15 days due to on-board data recorder fill, Safe Hold mode, and data downloads. In total, there are 17.92 days of science data collected in Sector 77.</td>

points near the North Ecliptic Pole. Camera 4 was used for guiding in both orbits.</td>
