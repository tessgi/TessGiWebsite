Pointing performance was highly variable during the engineering tests. Data during the engineering test is available on MAST archive. The Manual Exclude data quality flag (bit 8) is set in the FFI, 2-min, and 20-sec data products during the engineering test. Data during the engineering test was excluded for analysis in PDC, TPS, and DV</p>

Data continued to be collected while in Coarse Pointing: these data are flagged and removed from the PDCSAP FLUX light curves and transiting planet search. The FFIs are also flagged for Coarse Pointing.</td>

Camera 1 and Camera 4 were both used for guiding in Orbit 139a and 140a, while Camera 4 alone was used for guiding in Orbit 139b and 140b.  Pointing performance during the engineering testing (>3124.2 TJD) is highly variable, and the PDC, TPS, and DV modules ignored data beyond this timestamp; the manual exclude data quality flag (bit 8) also identifies data impacted by the engineering test.</td>
