%% The default font was chosen to be easily readable while allowing

%% Please note that the proposal will be printed on US Letter size paper,
%% 8.5 in x 11 in, and that formatting the text for other sizes will
%% generally cause layout problems and may result in text being cut
%% off near the edges. PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THE 'LETTERPAPER' OPTION
%% IN THE DOCUMENTCLASS COMMAND.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%% Default format: 11pt single column %%%%%

%% NOTE: NASA ROSES requires body font size to be no smaller than 15 
%% characters per inch (equivalent to Times Roman 12 point).

%% Minimum margin size is 1 inch from top, bottom, and sides.

%%%%% HOW TO INCLUDE FIGURES %%%%%

%% Please see the ``Included packages'' section below.

%%%%% Included packages %%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\usepackage{graphics,graphicx}
\usepackage[colorlinks]{hyperref}
\hypersetup{urlcolor=blue}
\usepackage{cleveref}

%% Feel free to modify the included packages list to use your
%% favorite packages. 

%% In the graphics and graphicx packages, Postscript and eps figures
%% can be included using the \includegraphics command. The graphics
%% package is part of standard LaTeX2e and provides a basic way of including a
%% figure. The graphicx package is not standard, but extends the
%% \includegraphics command to make it more user-friendly. If graphicx
%% is not available on your system please remove it from the list of
%% included packages above.  

%% Syntax:
%% In the graphics package:
%%
%% \begin{figure}
%% \includegraphics[llx,lly][urx,ury]{file}
%% \end{figure}
%%
%% where ll denotes 'lower left' and ur 'upper right' and the x and y
%% values are the coordinates of the PostScript bounding box in
%% points. There are 72 points in an inch.
%%
%% In the graphicx package:
%% 
%% \begin{figure}
%% \includegraphics[key=val,key=val,...]{file}
%% \end{figure}
%%
%% where some of the useful keys are: angle, width, height,
%% keepaspectratio (='true' or 'false') and scale. Bounding box values
%% can be given as [bb=llx lly urx ury].
%%
%% In either case you have to use LaTeX figure placement commands to
%% position the figure on the page; \includegraphics will not do
%% that. Both these commands also have other options that are listed
%% in the LaTeX manual (for the graphics package) and in 'The LaTeX
%% Graphics Companion' (for the graphicx package).

\noindent{The recommended sections for a TESS GI proposal are shown below. Feel free to change section 
headings as necessary, but this is the suggested minimal information that should be included in the proposal. 
This Science/Technical section of the proposal is limited to 4 pages including figures for small programs and to 5 pages including figures for large programs and key projects. Page limits do not include references.} 


\section{Introduction}

Summarize the problem being addressed and give an overview of how your investigation will help. 
Why \tess, why now?


\section{Scientific Justification}

Provide text and figures that justify the scientific need for \tess\ observations and analyses here. 
Justify your choice of cadence. When applicable, justify your choice of new 2 min or 20 s cadence observations. 
If your program includes theoretical, simulation, or ground-based observing components, describe why these efforts are critical.


%% Trigger Criteria section:
%% comment this section out on proposals not asking for
%% Target of Opportunity (ToO) observations.

\subsection{({\it Only} For ToO Proposals) Trigger Criteria}

If the proposed investigation includes Targets of Opportunity (ToO's), describe also the circumstances 
under which a ToO is triggered, an estimated duration of the event(s), and an estimated probability for 
triggering the observations. Also discuss the potential science impact imposed by the delay in upload 
of the event due to \tess\ orbit/uplink constraints.

\subsection{({\it Only} For programs that require shared risk resources) Shared risk backup plan}

Proposers wishing to utilize 10-minute FFI cadence or 20-second cadence observing modes during Cycle 3 must identify the impact upon their science goals if only 30-minute FFIs and 2-minute cadence modes are available at the time of the observations. If the program cannot achieve its science goals without 20-second cadence or 10-minute FFI modes, this must be stated.

\section{Analysis Plan}

Discuss how you plan to analyze the \tess\ data (or for ground-based observing programs, the data collected). This includes the development of software tools.


\section{Technical Feasibility}

Provide text and figures showing that the proposed \tess\ investigations are feasible; consider the 
\tess\ survey strategy, target observability, and required signal-to-noise, etc. The \tess\ Science 
Support Center (\href{https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/}{TSSC}) makes several tools available to help estimate these quantities. For ground-based observing focused programs, a description of the resources that will be used should be described here.


\section{Expected Impact}

Summarize the expected science return of the proposed investigations and the expected benefit 
to the community, including new data products and software tools to be made publicly available.


\section{Work Plan}

Provide a brief (1 paragraph) work plan that provides details on how
the proposed effort will be carried out, including the allocation of
effort amongst investigators. Investigators who are proposing to
continue a program that was selected for funding in Cycles 1 and/or 2 may
describe why additional funds are required in Cycle 3. All proposals
requesting funds must also provide upon submission a bottom-line
budget number in the provided field of the ARK submission form; this
number should not be included in the body of the proposal. 

\section{References}

List of references. References {\it are {\bf not} included} when considering the
proposal page limit.


\section{Target Table}

When necessary to justify your proposal, provide a list of targets using the below example as a template for format. This target table is designed to aid reviewers and need only provide a representative sample of the complete target list uploaded to RPS. Full target tables should be submitted electronically with the Phase-1 proposal. Please limit this target table to only 1 page. The table is not included in the page limit of the Science/Technical section. Proposals including a target table may be up to 1 page longer, but only the target table may appear on the final page.
