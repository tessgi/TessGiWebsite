    "The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is a NASA-sponsored Astrophysics Explorer-class mission that is performing a near all-sky survey to search for planets transiting nearby stars. TESS completed its primary mission in July of 2020, and has now entered into its extended mission. The current extended mission will last until September 2022, and will continue to scan the sky for exoplanets and transient events. The TESS mission is now more community focused with larger guest investigator (GI) program.\n",
