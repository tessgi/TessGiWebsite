Title: The Extended mission
Save_as: extended.html

[TOC]

After the completion of its [prime mission](primary.html) in July of 2020, TESS entered its first extended mission which lasted approximately two years ending in September 2022.
This first extension of the TESS mission was much more community focused with a large [Guest Investigator Program](proposing-investigations.html).

The Cycle 3 call for proposals occurred on March 14th 2019, with the Cycle 4 on February 14th 2020.


## Observing strategy

TESS Cycle 3 comprised of Sectors 27 - 39, during which the Southern ecliptic hemisphere was re-observed, In these Sectors the instrument boresight was pointed at an ecliptic declination of -54째.

The TESS Cycle 3 coverage, dates, and camera information are shown below.

TESS Cycle 4 was comprised of 16 Sectors instead of 13, and as such lasted ~15 months running from Sectors 40-55. In this Cycle the Northern hemisphere was observed, with Sectors 40-41 sharing similar pointings to that of 14 and 15, at an ecliptic latitude of +85째. Sectors 42-46 were ecliptic pointings and Sectors 47-55 Northern hemisphere pointings at an ecliptic latitude of +54째. Sectors 52 and 53 then shifted north to +85째 to avoid scattered light in cameras 1 and 2.

## Data Products 

In Cycles 3 and 4 the following data products were produced, these are slightly different to those produced in the primary mission. 

* 2-minute cadence data for a select number of targets.
* 20-second cadence data for a select number of targets.
* 10-minute full frame images instead of 30-minute.

The 20-second cadence mode was allotted to ~600 targets per sector.
There was roughly a times increase in the number of 2-minute cadenced targets in the GI program compared to the prime mission, that is ~15,000 target slots in each sector.

##Proposal categories

With the extension of the mission, TESS became a Guest Investigator driven experiment, with >80% of the time dedicated to GI proposals. 

In Cycle 3 a new Key-Project proposal category was made available. These are programs that will had a maximum duration of 27 months and covered Cycle 3 and 4. They were large programs intended to have a significant scientific output.

In Cycle 4 a new Mini proposal category was made available. There programs required minimal resources, up to 50 20-second cadence targets and 1,000 2-minute cadence targets. Proposals in this category were not eligible for funding.

No Key projects were solicited in Cycle 4.

## Extended mission results

Cycle 3 received 150 proposal, with those selected covering a broad range of topics, from studies of comets in our own Solar System to searching for the counterparts of gamma-ray bursts. The full list of Cycle 3 proposals can be found on our [selection page](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/approved-programs.html#cycle-3).

The Cycle 4 review was in March, with 146 proposals submitted. Of these proposals 12 were large, 110 small, and 24 mini - our most recent proposal category. These 146 proposals were split into one of four fields: Exoplanet (33), Stellar Astrophysics (62), Accretion and Extragalactic (19), and Ground-based Focused (32). The proposals were then assessed by one of seven panels.

In total 62 proposals were accepted with the following breakdown:

Our [approved programs page](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/approved-programs.html#cycle-4) provides the full list of accepted Cycle 4 proposals. 

To date there have been over 700 publications utilizing the TESS data. Now in the extended mission the number of publications related to non-exoplanet science (57%) have overtaken those focusing on exoplanets only (43%), see our [publications page](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/publications.html) for more information.
