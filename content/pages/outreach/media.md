Title: Is your TESS research result news-worthy?
Save_as: media.html

[TOC]

## Media support 

NASA can provide media support that can help amplify your results so that they reach a wide audience. NASA Goddard Space Flight Center's Astrophysics Division Communications Team has extensive experience creating press products based on results: from coordinating and writing web features and press releases, producing supporting videos, and commissioning animations, and even planning a press event if the result is significant enough.

## TESS Media Coverage Request

Submit a [TESS Media Coverage Request](https://asd.gsfc.nasa.gov/media_req/) for media support consideration. The team needs an adequate heads up of your coming results, about six weeks in most cases. Please consider submitting a media request at the same time you submit a paper for publication, and *before submitting it to a preprint server (like arXiv)*.

A copy of this form will be emailed to the Goddard's Astrophysics Division Communications Team Leadership: Amber Straughn, Claire Saravia, Frank Reddy, Barb Mattson, and Jeanette Kazmierczak. If a paper is associated with this submission, please also send a current draft of your paper to TESS' Media Contact [Claire Saravia, Office of Communications](mailto:claire.g.desaravia@nasa.gov).
