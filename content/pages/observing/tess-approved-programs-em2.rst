This page details the `Guest Investigator programs <proposing-investigations.html>`_ executed by TESS during the second extension of its mission.

The target lists are posted on this page
as soon as the team has prepared the final target list
for upload to the spacecraft, which happens shortly before the start
of a sector.

You can click on the title of each program to read a summary
of the research objectives.

For GI programs executed as part of the primary mission please see the `primary mission proposals page <approved-programs-primary.html>`_ .
For GI programs executed as part of the first extension of the mission please see the `first mission extension proposals page <approved-programs.html>`_ .
