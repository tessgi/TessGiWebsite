## Guest Investigator program

The TESS Guest Investigator program is intended to enable science investigations outside of the [core mission science goals](science.html). The program enables teams to proposal the collection of new 2-minute cadence targets, and provides funding to US investigators to analyse 2-minute cadence and full-frame image data.

The TESS primary mission duration is two years. The first year is spent in the southern hemisphere and is corresponds to TESS Guest Investigator Program Cycle 1, the second year observed the northern hemisphere and it Cycle 2. During the primrary mission, the majority of the 2-minute cadence targets observed will be taken from the [TESS Candidate Target list (CTL)](observing-technical.html#candidate-target-list). In each Cycle 1 around 10,000 2-minute cadnence target slots will be assigned to the Guest Invesitgator Program.

Consistent with Explorer Program policy, there will be no proprietary data rights to observations conducted with TESS. All data will be made freely available through the MAST archive as soon as they are received and processed. 


### Permitted science areas

We welcome proposals addressing compelling scientific questions 
in almost any area of astrophysics and planetary science
providing the required observations are amenable 
to the operational characteristics and constraints of the mission. The science motivation may include, but is not limited to, 
exoplanet characterization, stellar astrophysics, 
galactic and extragalactic astrophysics, and solar system science. 

The **only** science topic that Guest Investigators are not permitted to propose is work which directly reproduces the [primary science of the mission](science.html). Explicitly, this restriction is limited to investigations whose aim is to detect planets smaller than 4 earth-radii orbiting stars that are on the [Candidate Target List](observing-technical.html#candidate-target-list).

The proposed TESS Guest Investigation must clearly enhance the science return of the TESS mission. The scientific justification of the proposal should focus on a compelling TESS science investigation, that requires TESS data to succeed. The proposal may include limited theoretical components, unique ground-based follow-up, software development and/or data simulation that strengthens the proposal. However, at least 70% of the work effort should be focused on utilizing TESS data products. 

Proposals may utilized either the 2-minute cadence, the full-frame image data, or both. All science proposals must be compelling and carefully justified
scientifically and technically. 

Proposers must take into account the difference between science 
that can be achieved exclusively using full-frame image data 
and science that requires new observations at 2-minute cadence. 

The TESS GI program is specific to the case of science 
requiring new observations. Funding for archival science is instead provided through the Astrophysics Data Analysis Program ([ADAP](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?method=init&solId={9B644CB9-C0A8-8F23-DE92-FA3837D2F0BD}&path=init)). 
All proposals to TESS calls therefore must justify 
the need for new observational data within their program. 
However, we welcome proposals that build upon data already collected 
and programs requiring more data to enhance or complete investigations.

Any software developed with TESS GI funds must add value to the TESS science community, be free and open source, with the source code made publicly available. Any ground-based follow-up data collected through TESS GI funding support must be made publicly available in a timely fashion on a public data archive such as MAST. Any supporting exoplanet data should be archived through the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute (NExScI)--- NASA’s repository for supporting exoplanet data. Proposals must clearly describe the plans to make any new software or supporting data publicly available.



### Evaluation criteria

Proposals submitted in response to GI calls will be evaluated 
with respect to the criteria specified 
in Section C.2 of the [NASA Guidebook for Proposers](http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/nraguidebook/), which are intrinsic merit,
relevance to the GI solicitation, 
and the realism/reasonableness of the proposed work effort and resources. 
In addition to the factors for intrinsic merit 
given in the NASA Guidebook for Proposers, 
intrinsic merit includes the following factors:

* The suitability of using the TESS survey and data products for the proposed investigation; 
* The extent to which the investigation complements and enhances the anticipated science return from the TESS mission; 
* The degree to which the proposed investigation places demands upon mission resources; and
* The degree to which the proposed investigation capitalizes on the unique capabilities of TESS. 
 
All proposals are peer-reviewed and ranked by a panel of professional volunteers, followed by ratification from NASA Headquarters. The members of the peer-review panel will not be disclosed. The deliberations of the panel will be disclosed to PIs only after ratification by the selecting official.

NASA recognizes and supports the benefits of having diverse and inclusive
scientific, engineering, and technology communities and fully expects that such values
will be reflected in the composition of all panels and teams including peer review panels
(science, engineering, and technology), proposal teams, science definition teams, and
mission and instrument teams.

### Availability of funds

It is anticipated that up to $2.5M in Cycle 1 will be available through this solicitation for the support of approximately ~40 Guest Investigations of one-year duration each. Note that additional unfunded Guest Investigation targets may be selected and observed, if target resources permit. TESS 2-minute cadence observations are open to all scientists at U.S. or non-U.S. institutions. TESS GI funding is open to all individuals who are identified as Principal Investigators and employed at U.S. institutions, including TESS science team members. Scientists participating in the TESS mission, including members of the Follow-up Team who are not funded by the Project, are eligible for support under this GI Program. TESS science team members who already receive support from the Project must provide a compelling justification for the award of additional funds under the GI Program. 

There are typically two categories of TESS GI proposals, investigators are free to select the catagory that best reflects their scope of their proposed work.
 * Small proposals - proposals of limited scope and are capped at a budget of $50,000. Funding will be allocated via a formula.
 * Large proposals - proposal of wide-ranging scope and science yield. Large proposals must deliver a clear benefit for the broader scientific community

Funding for selected programs typically starts upon availability 
of data to the public archive 
at [MAST](http://archive.stsci.edu/tess/). 
Note that there is no exclusive use period associated with any TESS data. 



### Eligibility

Application to the TESS GI program is typically open to all investigators,
including those from outside the U.S. under NASA’s no-exchange-of-funds policy. 

Investigators who are not affiliated with a U.S. institution 
are not eligible for funding through this program,
but may submit proposals that will be reviewed and ranked 
along with eligible proposals for the purpose of allocating targets.

Funding through the NASA TESS GI Program is available only to scientists at U.S. institutions who are identified as the Principal Investigators (PIs). U.S. based Co-Investigators (Co-Is) on foreign-led proposals do not qualify for funding. Funding for accepted target proposals will be initiated only after the relevant observations have begun. Proposers from non-U.S. institutions are strongly encouraged to include a letter of commitment promising financial support.

In accordance with Public Law 113--76, Division B, Title V, Section 532, NASA cannot support bilateral participation, collaboration, or coordination with China or any Chinese-owned company or entity, whether funded or performed under a no-exchange-of-funds arrangement. See Section III(c) of the ROSES-2016 NRA for more information on these restrictions. 

## Target selection

### TESS Input Catalog
When a target is in the TESS Input Catalog (TIC), investigators must include the TIC identification number. The latest version of the TIC is [available from the MAST](data-access.html).

## Solicitations


### FAQs  

<!-- * **What are the proposal deadlines?**<br/>
The deadlines for GO Cycle 5 have passed.  Stay tuned for a call
for GO Cycle 6.
  
* **What are the anticipated dates of the campaigns included in the
current solicitation?**<br/>
Campaign 14: 2017 May 31 - Aug 19 <br/>
Campaign 15: 2017 Aug 23 - Nov 20 <br/>
Campaign 16: 2017 Dec 07 - 2018 Feb 25 <br/>
Start and stop dates for all campaigns are approximate, flexible and
could be overtaken by unanticipated operational events.<br/>

* **Where are the fields located on the sky for the campaigns included in the
current solicitation?**<br/>
The pointings for all K2 campaigns can be found on the <a
href="k2-fields.html">fields page.</a> Proposers
should be aware that changes were made to the pointing for Campaign 16 and should only propose for
 targets that are on active silicon in the updated Campaign 16
 field.  All investigators *must* update their version of the
<a href="software.html#k2fov">K2fov target selection tool</a>
to account for the recent changes to Campaign 16. <br/>

* **Should I submit one proposal or two?**<br/>
  In the interest of efficiency, proposers are requested *NOT* to provide separate proposals with identical science cases for each of the campaigns. If the same science goals are spread across both campaigns, please provide one science justification and two target tables, one for each field.<br/>
  
* **How do I select targets on silicon?**<br/>
  In order to avoid inefficiency for proposers, you are encouraged to
  use the <a href="software.html#k2fov">K2fov tool</a> to
  determine whether your targets fall upon silicon and propose only
  those that do. The precision of this tool is a few 4x4 arcsec
  detector pixels. <br/>

* **Should I apply for targets that do not fall on silicon?**<br/>
  Please, no. Proposing off-silicon targets is a waste of energy for proposers, reviewers and project staff. Use <a href="software.html#k2fov">K2fov</a> and apply only for targets that fall upon silicon (output flag "2").<br/>

* **What is the K2 Ecliptic Plane Input Catalog (EPIC)?**<br/>
  Proposers are asked to submit targets that have been selected from the <a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/k2/epic/search.php">EPIC</a>. The EPIC plays the same role for K2 that the <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011AJ....142..112B">Kepler Input Catalog (KIC)</a> played for Kepler target selection. The primary purpose of the catalog is to define photometric apertures for each potential target by providing celestial positions and Kepler bandpass magnitudes. EPIC parameters are produced by source matching existing multi-band catalogs and calculating color corrections for the Kepler bandpass. Documentation describing the compilation of the EPIC is provided <a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/k2/epic.pdf">here</a>.<br/>

* **What type of science targets can be proposed?**<br/>
  There are no constraints on the type of science or science target that can be proposed.<br/>

* **How many targets can be proposed?**<br/>
  Both long cadence (30-min exposure) and short cadence (1-min
  exposure) targets will be observed during each Campaign. There are
  no constraints whatsoever on the number of targets that can be
  proposed. The total long cadence target list is expected to be
  between 10,000 and 20,000 targets per Campaign. Approximately 50 to 100 short cadence targets are anticipated per Campaign.<br/>

* **How many pixels around each target will be collected?**<br/>
  The number of pixels collected for each target depends on the
  target's Kepler magnitude.  For Kp = 12, the target pixel masks include
  approximately 100 pixels.  Extra halos of pixels will be added to K2 masks in order to capture uncertainties in field acquisition (currently a pixel) and pointing drift over time (currently a pixel).<br/>

* **Are there bright or faint magnitude limits?**<br/>
  There are no faint limits upon the brightness of targets that can be
  proposed. Bright targets will be significantly more expensive in
  terms of pixel usage. Targets brighter than 3rd magnitude in the
  Kepler bandpass cannot be observed because charge bleeding along CCD
  pixel columns will fall into collateral pixels of the
  detector. Bright targets (Kp < 9) and short cadence targets require
  strong, compelling science cases.<br/>

* **How do I propose a moving target?**<br/>
 The proposal process is the same for a Solar System or moving target
 as it is for other targets. However, proposers should take note of
 recommendations when creating the [target table for moving targets](k2-proposing-targets.html#target-table). -->


### Submission process

<!-- K2 proposal submission is a 2-step process. Both steps are
mandatory. To propose for Campaigns 14, 15 and 16, investigators are
required to submit Step 1 through the NSPIRES website by <font color='black'>23:59 EST
November 3, 2016</font> and are required to submit Step 2 to the NSPIRES
website by <font color='black'>23:59 EST December 15, 2016</font>. All proposers need to register
with NSPIRES in order to submit both parts of the proposal. The
separation of the proposal into two steps is required in order to
expedite the completion of review administration and target
engineering before the start of Campaign 14. Detailed instructions for
submitting a K2 proposal to the GO call are provided below:

    within the
    [K2 GO Cycle 5 NRA](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?method=init&solId={D68A4380-B327-7C96-04CF-02B0FC940DBF}&path=open)
    and are summarized in the table below.   The
    right-hand column provides page limits for the package elements. Caveats to the page limits are provided as footnotes. *The page limits on this website override the NRA-generic limits within the handbook.*
    The Scientific/Technical/Management section of the
    Step 2 proposal, which consists of text, tables (excluding the
    target table), and figures must not exceed four pages for
    proposals in the Small category, or six pages for proposals in the
    Large category. An additional 0.5 pages is allowed in Large proposals to describe
    progress the proposers have made to delivering value-added
    community resources.  References and the target table do not count against the four or
    six page
    limit, however, the
completed package uploaded to NSPIRES for the Scientific/Technical/Management
    section must not exceed 15 pages. If a large target
table extends beyond the 15 page limit then truncate the table so that
the page limit is not exceeded and make a note within the proposal
that the table has been truncated. Page limits for the PI and Co-I biographies and
    current and pending support are defined below, and are 
    separate from the 15 page limit for the
    Scientific/Technical/Management section.  PIs should not feel compelled to
meet the page limits, but must submit all items appropriate to their
proposal and should not exceed the page limits as defined below.

In summary, proposers should:

  * Understand the scope of the
        Guest Observer program. Science papers exploiting data from the Kepler and K2 mission can be found [here](publications.html).
  * Familiarize yourself with the [technical documentation](data-products.html#documentation) for the mission.
  * Develop and justify a science concept for observations
          within Campaigns specific to the current GO Cycle <a href="fields.html"></a>.
   * Identify appropriate targets for the proposed observations using the
        <a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/k2/epic/search.php">K2 Target Search</a> page as the primary (but not exclusive) source list. This search page provides for the construction of short or long target lists based upon e.g. celestial cone searches, magnitude and color.
   * Include a [Target Table](k2-proposing-targets.html#target-table)
     as an integral component of the proposal and as a separate
     submission to the Guest Observer Office at **keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov**. 
   * Provide the administrative elements of the proposal
          including a proposer biographical information, and a
          statement of current and pending financial support.
   * **Large proposals that anticipate delivery of a data product/products
  to one of the NASA archives (e.g., MAST or the NASA Exoplanet
  Database) for curation must also include a letter of acknowledgement from
  the relevant archive.**
   * **Although a detailed budget is not requested in either Step 1 or
  Step 2 proposals, the Step 2 proposal should include either a
  statement of work or a table summarizing the work effort.  If the
  statement of work is included in the Scientific/Technical/Management
  section it will count against the page limit for that section, but a
  table can be included as a separate section that will not count
  against the Scientific/Technical/Management section page limit .**  The
  statement of work should clearly identify any and all members of the proposing team
  who would receive funding under the proposed investigation. The
  funding amounts will be determined formulaically based on target
  allocation.**
  * **Special instructions for non-US PIs**<br/>
During the submission process, non-US PI-led proposals will need to be
affiliated to a submitting organization. Do this by clicking on the
"Account Mgmt" tab at the top of the NSPIRES page and follow the
instructions. All non-US proposals should use the "Kepler Guest
Observer Office" as your affiliation within NSPIRES. This is simply a
fudge, albeit a required fudge, so that non-US PIs spend no more
effort than this over the institutional endorsements that are
mandatory for US investigators. When completing the proposal, there are a few obscure boxes on the standard form that need your attention. The organization name is "Kepler Guest Observer Office", doing business as the "Kepler Guest Observer Office". The DUNS number is "999999954" and the cage code is "ZZZ54". These details will make sense to you when you see the Step 2 proposal form. --> 


### Director's Discretionary Time

A small part of the pixel budget may be allocated by the project as Director's Discretionary Targets (DDT),
which is intended to facilitate observations that address
scientific topics missed in the proposal review process.
More information and deadlines are available from the [DDT program page](ddt.html).
