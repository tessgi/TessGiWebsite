##Targets not processed in 2-min pipeline:
329269366, 219827143, and 255909448

##Blended stars:
279979429, 283819432, 334487469, 341873045, 354379201, 441804568, 2022481918, 2022482049

A star is considered to be bended when its flux has been significantly contaminated by a nearby bright star(s). Since the contaminating flux is considered very large, the resulting photometry for such targets is expected to be unreliable.

##Contaminated stars:
274221477

These targets are closely blended with brighter neighbors. In these cases, the assigned apertures are disjoint and the resulting photometry is unreliable.
