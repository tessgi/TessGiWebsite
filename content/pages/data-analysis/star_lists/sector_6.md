##Targets not processed in 2-min pipeline:
255559489, 238196512, 38877693, 134501440, and 322899250.

##Blended stars:
93279196, 50743458, and 300015238 had very bright unresolved stars nearby (93280676, 50743469, and 300015239, respectively).

A star is considered to be bended when its flux has been significantly contaminated by a nearby bright star(s). Since the contaminating flux is considered very large, the resulting photometry for such targets is expected to be unreliable.

##Not capturing bleed trails:
436103278, 269273552, 220393543, 124918771, 124751941, 156934909, and 150110391
