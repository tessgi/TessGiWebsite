TIC ID's that had issues in Sector 19.

##Targets not processed in 2-min pipeline:
471011465, 440388263, and 96868656

##Blended stars:
407514449, 441804565, 471011933


A star is considered to be bended when its flux has been significantly contaminated by a nearby bright star(s). Since the contaminating flux is considered very large, the resulting photometry for such targets is expected to be unreliable.

##Contaminated stars:
407514449, 609754542 and 609754520

These targets are closely blended with brighter neighbors. In these cases, the assigned apertures are disjoint and the resulting photometry is unreliable.

##Not capturing bleed trails:
354379201 and 441804565

Targets with pixel stamps that did not fully capture the bleed trails.
