##Targets not processed in 2-min pipeline:
255559489, 44577667, 38877693, 238196512, and 394046358

##Blended stars:
167602316, 300015238, 389363695, 471013491, 766018849, 2028776534

A star is considered to be bended when its flux has been significantly contaminated by a nearby bright star(s). Since the contaminating flux is considered very large, the resulting photometry for such targets is expected to be unreliable.

##Contaminated stars:
506939512

These targets are closely blended with brighter neighbors. In these cases, the assigned apertures are disjoint and the resulting photometry is unreliable.


##Not captured:
279316667
