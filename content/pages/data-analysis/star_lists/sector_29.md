TIC ID's that had issues in Sector 29.

##Targets not processed in 2-min pipeline:
38877693, 230981971, 80256524, 238196512, and 47552789.

##Blended stars:
167602316, 271503437, 271503441, 300015238, 766018849

A star is considered to be bended when its flux has been significantly contaminated by a nearby bright star(s). Since the contaminating flux is considered very large, the resulting photometry for such targets is expected to be unreliable.

##Contaminated stars:
214664575

These targets are closely blended with brighter neighbors. In these cases, the assigned apertures are disjoint and the resulting photometry is unreliable.
