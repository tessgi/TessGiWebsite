##Targets not processed in 2-min pipeline:
423088367, 331777607, 96868656, 46117984, and 245873777

#Bleed star 
239187687
This star lies very close to the bleed trails of a saturated star. In this case, no background pixels were assigned. Target pixel files with original and calibrated pixel data are provided, but no light curve was produced.

##Blended stars:
800823400, 504952282, 27550294, and 117355623

A star is considered to be bended when its flux has been significantly contaminated by a nearby bright star(s). Since the contaminating flux is considered very large, the resulting photometry for such targets is expected to be unreliable.
