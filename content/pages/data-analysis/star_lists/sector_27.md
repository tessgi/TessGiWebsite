##Targets not processed in 2-min pipeline:
238196512, 394046358, 38877693

##Blended stars:
167602316, 267211065, 300015238, 730543928, 766018849, 1991380115

A star is considered to be bended when its flux has been significantly contaminated by a nearby bright star(s). Since the contaminating flux is considered very large, the resulting photometry for such targets is expected to be unreliable.

##Contaminated stars:
2025820827

These targets are closely blended with brighter neighbors. In these cases, the assigned apertures are disjoint and the resulting photometry is unreliable.
