[TOC]

TIC ID's that had issues in Sector 46.

##Targets not processed in 2-min pipeline:
95431294 and 51735845

##Blended stars:
184842717, 903126673 and 350347140

A star is considered to be bended when its flux has been significantly contaminated by a nearby bright star(s). Since the contaminating flux is considered very large, the resulting photometry for such targets is expected to be unreliable.

##Aperture issue
