[TOC]

TIC ID's that had issues in Sector 2.

##Targets not processed in 2-min pipeline:
80256524, 47552789, 238196512, and 38877693.

##Targets placed on the wrong CCD in Camera 4:
374942153 and 350433330.

No optimal apertures or light curves were produced

##Blended stars:
214664575 and 300015238 have very bright stars nearby (214664574 and 300015239, respectively).
231005052 and 231005905.

A star is considered to be bended when its flux has been significantly contaminated by a nearby bright star(s). Since the contaminating flux is considered very large, the resulting photometry for such targets is expected to be unreliable.

##Not capturing bleed trails:
230981971

Targets with pixel stamps that did not fully capture the bleed trails.
