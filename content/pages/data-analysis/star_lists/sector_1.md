TIC ID's that had issues in Sector 1.

##Targets not processed in 2-min pipeline:
44577667, 238196512, 394046358, and 38877693

##Targets placed on the wrong CCD in Camera 4:
149251611, 220478335, 149542119, 300160320, and 176954932

No optimal apertures or light curves were produced

##Blended stars:
253923637 and 300015238have very bright stars nearby (253923638 and 300015239, respectively).

A star is considered to be bended when its flux has been significantly contaminated by a nearby bright star(s). Since the contaminating flux is considered very large, the resulting photometry for such targets is expected to be unreliable.

##Not capturing bleed trails:
197641601

Targets with pixel stamps that did not fully capture the bleed trails.

##Off center targets 
281592043, 419793478, 469844770, and 469849622

These targets are near the corners of Camera 2, are off-center in their pixel stamps. This was due to an error in the focal plane geometry model that was corrected for future sectors. As a consequence, the optimal aper- tures are clipped by the edge of the stamps. Other targets in the corners of Camera 2 may also be slightly off-center; however, all other pixel stamps fully contain the optimal aperture
