##Targets not processed in 2-min pipeline:
322899250, 64602863, 255559489, 38877693, 280310048

##Blended stars:
110798661, 300015238, and 354825493 had very bright unresolved stars nearby (110798652, 300015239 and 354825513 respectively).

A star is considered to be bended when its flux has been significantly contaminated by a nearby bright star(s). Since the contaminating flux is considered very large, the resulting photometry for such targets is expected to be unreliable.

##Not capturing bleed trails:
80466973, 124751941, 156934909, and 269407223

Targets with pixel stamps that did not fully capture the bleed trails.
