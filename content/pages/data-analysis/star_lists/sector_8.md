##Targets not processed in 2-min pipeline:
134501440, 38877693, 31975064, 255559489, 46799297, 238001475

##Blended stars:
300015238 and 354825493 had very bright unresolved stars nearby (300015239 and 354825513 respectively).


A star is considered to be bended when its flux has been significantly contaminated by a nearby bright star(s). Since the contaminating flux is considered very large, the resulting photometry for such targets is expected to be unreliable.


##Not capturing bleed trails:
342884451 and 269407223

Targets with pixel stamps that did not fully capture the bleed trails.
