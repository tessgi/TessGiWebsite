##Targets not processed in 2-min pipeline:
272314138, 399646462, 471011144, 471011145, 38877693, 179323446, 440960978, 30247429, 328329822, and 39613911

##Blended stars:
300015238 and 300015239


A star is considered to be bended when its flux has been significantly contaminated by a nearby bright star(s). Since the contaminating flux is considered very large, the resulting photometry for such targets is expected to be unreliable.


##Not capturing bleed trails:
148415949, 290794924, 333947284, 333950446, 390442076, 450568754, 453885273, 460532958
