##Targets not processed in 2-min pipeline:

##Blended stars:
300015238 and 306829960 were blended with 300015239 and 306829961 respectively.


A star is considered to be bended when its flux has been significantly contaminated by a nearby bright star(s). Since the contaminating flux is considered very large, the resulting photometry for such targets is expected to be unreliable.
