##Targets not processed in 2-min pipeline:
186744198 and 292057658

##Blended stars:
101255849, 279979429, 334487469, 341873045, 354379201, 441804565, 2022481918


A star is considered to be bended when its flux has been significantly contaminated by a nearby bright star(s). Since the contaminating flux is considered very large, the resulting photometry for such targets is expected to be unreliable.

##Contaminated stars:
445258198

This target lies within the same pixel of a very bright star (445258206, Tmag = 2.8). In this case, no optimal aperture was assigned. A target pixel file with raw data is provided, but no light curve was produced.

##Not capturing bleed trails:
431863107 and 441804565

Targets with pixel stamps that did not fully capture the bleed trails.
