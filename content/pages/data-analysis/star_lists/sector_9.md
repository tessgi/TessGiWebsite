##Targets not processed in 2-min pipeline:
31975064, 38877693, 238196512, and 438741592

##Blended stars:
300015238 and 354825493 had very bright unresolved stars nearby (300015239 and 354825513 respectively).


A star is considered to be bended when its flux has been significantly contaminated by a nearby bright star(s). Since the contaminating flux is considered very large, the resulting photometry for such targets is expected to be unreliable.


##Not capturing bleed trails:
220393543, 269407223, 354825493, 385220745, 93549165, and 45696212
