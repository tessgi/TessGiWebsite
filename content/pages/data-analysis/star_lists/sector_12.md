##Targets not processed in 2-min pipeline:
364216056, 471011144, 191437754, 396139114, 171207618, 399646462, 38877693, 471011145, 325635393, 238196512

##Blended stars:
300015238 and 300015239


A star is considered to be bended when its flux has been significantly contaminated by a nearby bright star(s). Since the contaminating flux is considered very large, the resulting photometry for such targets is expected to be unreliable.


##Not capturing bleed trails:
17158018, 171611328, 175627991, 205175750, 325709821, 338104678, 338105219, 384196595, 412724758
