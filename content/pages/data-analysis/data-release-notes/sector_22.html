       <p>There were three watchdog timer resets in Sector 22: on 2/29/20, 3/3/20, and 3/12/20.</p>
       <p>Besides introducing short gaps in the 2m cadence data, these resets resulted in the loss a total of four FFI cadences.</p>

       <td colspan="5"><p>The reported times for previous data products are too large by 2 seconds. This issue has been fixed for Sector 22 data products, which have updated and accurate timestamps.</p>
       <p>Timestamps from previous sectors can be corrected by subtracting 2 seconds. Future data releases will include reprocessed data with corrected timestamps.</p>
       <p>The start times of integrations for every 2 minute and 30 minute cadence have been shifted forward by 31 milliseconds, and the end times have been shifted forward by 11 milliseconds.</p>
       <p>These offsets correct for effects in the focal plane electronics that were not accounted for in previous data releases. Until data is re-processed the times must be adjusted by adding correct values to headers.</p>
       <p>Two-minute data products report the TJD at mid-exposure, and so should be corrected by adding 21 milliseconds to the timestamps.</p>
       <p>Note that the correction only applies to the timestamps themselves; the reported exposure times in data product headers and flux values (electrons per second) are correct.</p></td>
