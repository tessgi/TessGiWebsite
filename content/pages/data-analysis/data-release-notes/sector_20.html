       <td colspan="5">In Sector 20, the the FFI timestamps have been adjusted for the 0.5 second staggered readouts of the four cameras and the 0.02 second staggered readouts for individual CCDs within a camera.<p></p>
       The assigned timestamps of the previously released data products are too large by 2 seconds. The issue was caused by an off-by-one error in ground system software that identifies the timestamps of individual two second exposures. The Sector 20 data products have been updated and have accurate timestamps<p></p>
       The start times of integrations for every 2 minute and 30 minute cadence were shifted forward by 31 milliseconds, and the end times were shifted forward by 11 milliseconds. These offsets correct for effects in the focal plane electronics that were not accounted for in previous data releases.<p></p>
       Until sectors 1-19 are re-processed, the adjustments mentioned above should be applied to the FFI image headers. <p></p>
        Two-minute data products report the TJD at mid-exposure, and so should be corrected by adding 21 milliseconds to the timestamps.<p></p>
        Note that the correction only applies to the timestamps themselves.<p></p>
        In Sector 20, the photometric apertures for targets with Tmag < 11 were slightly increased. This change most noticeably affects the light curves of saturated stars, which had higher flux losses during periods of increased pointing jitter using the smaller apertures.<p></p></td>
