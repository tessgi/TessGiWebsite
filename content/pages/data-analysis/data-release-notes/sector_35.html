        <td colspan="5">The spacecraft passed through the shadow of the Earth at the end of orbit 77. During this time, the instrument was turned off and no data were collected for 6.26 	hours between TJD 2266.1091 and 2266.3700. The thermal state of the spacecraft changed during this time, and trends in the raw photometry and target positions are apparent 	after data collection resumed.</td>

       <td colspan="3">Spacecraft pointing:</td>
       <td colspan="5">Approximately 40 minutes after the start of orbit 78, the spacecraft dropped out of Fine Pointing mode. For the next 3.44 days—between TJD 2268.5758 and 2272.0133—the spacecraft was in Coarse Pointing mode: in this mode, the spacecraft attitude drifts by about 1.5 pixels on timescales of 1 hour. Data continued to be collected while in Coarse Pointing: these data are flagged and removed from the PDCSAP FLUX light curves and transiting planet search. The FFIs are also flagged for Coarse Pointing. See the DRN Section 4.1 for more information about this.
       <p>Camera 4 alone was used for guiding in orbit 77 of Sector 35. Camera 1 and Camera 4 were both used for guiding in orbit 78.</p>
