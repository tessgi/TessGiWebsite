The TESS team is looking forward to attending the upcoming [AGU fall meeting](https://www.agu.org/Fall-Meeting) meeting in New Orleans next week. 

Members from both the TESS GI and MIT offices will be there staffing a booth all week, both in person and [virtually](https://go.nasa.gov/NASA_AGU2021), allowing us to serve as a live Helpdesk for all your TESS-related questions. 

During the event Dr. Rebekah Hounsell will be holding two sessions in the learning area during which she will teach you, the user, how to find an exoplanet with TESS data. These sessions will be held on Tuesday December 14th, at 4:30 pm - 5:00 pm (CST), and Thursday December 16th, at 1:30 pm - 2:00 pm (CST). Below we provide the notebook which will be discussed during this tutorial, as well as a factsheet that might help first time TESS users.

In addition, you can stop by the NASA traveling Hyperwall on Thursday, December 16th, at 5:00 pm - 5:15 pm (CST) when Dr. Avi Shpoer from MIT will present an overview of the TESS mission. 

We hope you can join us at one or more of these activities! A summary of the TESS activities at the fall AGU is provided below with times listed in CST.
