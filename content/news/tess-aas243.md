The TESS Science Support Center would like to draw  your attention to the following events being hosted by the team at AAS 243.  

- <ins>NASA's TESS Mission Interactive Data Workshop:</ins> Saturday, January 6, 2024, 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM 
- <ins>Science from the TESS Extended Mission Splinter Session:</ins> Tuesday, January 9, 2024, 6:30 PM - 8:30 PM 

NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has been in operation since July 2018, monitoring millions of stars across the entire sky and discovering thousands of exoplanets and exoplanet candidates. The field of view observed approximately each month by TESS is 24 x 96 degrees, with data collected at a 200-second cadence. TESS's capability for precision photometry over long time baselines, as well as open access to the data, have resulted in extraordinarily high scientific output from the mission across a broad range of astrophysics.  

Our TESS Workshop will consist of; i) short talks introducing the NASA TESS mission ii) explanations of how to propose for TESS observations and obtain research funding in upcoming proposal calls iii) tutorials on working with TESS data and iv) an interactive work-with-the-experts session to show you how to work with TESS data on your own targets. Please [register online](https://aas.org/meetings/aas243/registration) for this **free interactive session** and remember to bring a laptop! 

At the TESS Splinter Session we will provide an overview of the TESS Mission operations and science goals. We highlight TESS's impact across all areas of astronomy, sharing some of the amazing new science being conducted with TESS including exoplanet detections, stellar physics, and discoveries of transient events and other time-domain phenomena. 

We look forward to seeing you at the AAS!
