**UPDATE: the proposal deadline has been changed to October 6, 2017**

We have made available a [Microsoft Word format proposal template](proposing-investigations.html#proposal-templates). The aim of creating this is to aid in preparing the proposal document and avoiding compliance issue. There is no requirement to use this template.

As a reminder, proposals should include a Science/Technical/Management section that does not exceed 4-pages long. This page limit includes references and figures. The proposals are due on September 29, 2017.

Update: we have also made available [Latex and PDF version of the template](proposing-investigations.html#proposal-templates).
