Hello and welcome TESS followers to this special news bulletin! Here we will discuss the results of the Cycle 7 proposal season.

The Cycle 7 review was held earlier this year in late May, with over 120 proposals submitted, seven of which being joint proposals. Of these proposals 14 were large, 96 small, and 13 mini. These proposals were split into one of five fields: Exoplanet (33), Stellar Astrophysics (77), Accretion and Extragalactic (5), Solar System (3), and Other (5). The proposals were then assessed by one of six panels.

In total 38 proposals were accepted, three of which were joint programs with Swift and/or NICER. The scientific breakdown of these proposals were as follows:

Congratulations to all successful PI's and Co-I's!
To those of you who did not receive acceptance letters this time round, we strongly encourage you to apply again in the future. 
Thank you all for the wonderful science proposed, it is through your hard work that the TESS mission is a success.
