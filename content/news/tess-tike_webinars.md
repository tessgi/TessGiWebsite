Welcome TESS followers to a special news bulletin in which we bring to your attention a series of webinars hosted by MAST.

This summer, MAST will host six weekly, hour-long webinars on their cloud science platform, [TIKE](https://timeseries.science.stsci.edu/hub/login?next=%2Fhub%2F). Join them for interactive sessions on using Python to access and analyze archival data in the cloud; no downloads necessary! The team will cover a wide range of topics, from APIs to machine learning, so whether you're an undergrad or a postdoc, there's sure to be something of interest to you.
