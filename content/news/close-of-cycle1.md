Thanks to the many people who submitted Cycle 1 TESS GI proposals, we are very pleased with the response. We are now in the proposal of organizing the review of proposals. 

We received over 140 proposals for nearly 100,000 unique 2-min cadence targets. About 60% of proposal were stellar astrophysics investigations (primarily studies of activity and asteroseismology), a third were focused on exoplanets, and the remaining included extragalactic and solar system investigations.

We anticipate that we will be oversubscribed by a factor of six in large programs, a factor of four in small programs, and a factor of five for 2-min cadence targets.
