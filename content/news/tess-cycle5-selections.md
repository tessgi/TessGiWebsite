Hello and welcome TESS followers to this special news bulletin! Here we will discuss the results of the Cycle 5 proposal season.

The Cycle 5 review was held earlier this year in May, with over 100 proposals submitted. Of these proposals 3 were Key, 7 were large, 77 small, and 14 mini. These proposals were split into one of four fields: Exoplanet (24), Stellar Astrophysics (42), Accretion and Extragalactic (15), and Ground-based Focused (20). The proposals were then assessed by one of five panels.

In total 49 proposals were accepted with the following breakdown:

Congratulations to all successful PI's and Co-I's!
To those of you who did not receive acceptance letters this time round, we strongly encourage you to apply again in the future. 
Thank you all for the wonderful science proposed, it is through your hard work that the TESS mission is a success.
