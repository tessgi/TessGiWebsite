Title: Investigating Magnetic Dynamo Evolution With TESS Field Dwarfs

PI: Angus, Ruth - Columbia University

Type: N/A

Summary: We propose to solve two mysteries surrounding magnetic dynamo evolution using TESS Full Frame Images (FFIs). Firstly, we will establish whether a newly discovered bimodality in the distribution of rotation periods is produced by a local star formation history perturbation or a previously unknown feature in the magnetic dynamo evolution of young, cool dwarfs. This will be achieved by measuring rotation periods from TESS FFIs for stars at a range of galactic positions. Secondly, we will calibrate the gyrochronology relations at old ages using TESS-HERMES spectra and Gaia proper motions. We will also quantify the precision and accuracy of gyrochronology using Gaia comoving pairs. Finally, we will provide a catalog of ~ 1 million rotation periods for TESS FFI stars.
