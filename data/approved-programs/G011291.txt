Title: Searching For Planets In The Continuous Viewing Zone With TESS Full Frame Image Data

PI: Quintana, Elisa - NASA/GSFC

Type: Small

Summary: TESS will observe over 85% of the sky in Full-Frame Images (FFIs). The overlap of sectors near the ecliptic poles provides ~350 days of coverage in the Continuous Viewing Zone (CVZ). This is a valuable place to search for planets due to the long baseline. Over 100,000 stars on the Candidate Target List in the CVZ will not have 2-min data, some these will host observable transiting exoplanets. We will discover over 200 planets in the CVZ using FFIs, and swiftly add them to the 2-min target list as ToOs. The new 2-min data, combined with FFIs, will provide a rich dataset to constrain planet and star properties, search for additional planets, and constrain planet masses through transit timing variations. This work provides a major contribution to the yield of the most valuable planets.
