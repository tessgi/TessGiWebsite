Title: Light Curves From TESS Full-Frame Images

PI: Huber, Daniel - University Of Hawaii (Manoa)

Type: Large

Summary: By covering a solid angle nearly 400 times larger than a single Kepler/K2 field, photometry from TESS Full Frame Images (FFIs) is expected to revolutionize time-domain astronomy over the coming years. However, light curves from FFIs will not be a standard TESS data product, and hence the success of science from FFIs relies on efforts by the community. Here we propose to develop and run a complete, end-to-end photometry pipeline for TESS FFI data, producing analysis-ready light curves for all FFI sources. Using powerful computing resources and software developed through community workshops within the TESS Asteroseismic Science Consortium, the light curves produced in this program will enable a vast array of science investigations across stellar astrophysics and exoplanet science.
