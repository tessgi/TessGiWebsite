Title: Searching Rgb Stars In TESS Cycle 1 Field For Exoplanets

PI: Olenick, Richard - University Of Dallas

Type: N/A

Summary: We propose observing 35 RGB target stars in the TESS Cycle 1 field using both 2-minute data and full-frame images to search for exoplanets. Several surveys have targeted giant stars such as bright G and L giants and open cluster giants. We propose examining M8 RGB stars to investigate a poorly studied population of Neptune Jupiter mass planets around evolved stars. RGB stars span a wide range of stellar masses, luminosities, and chemical compositions thereby allowing studies of exoplanets in a variety of host star environments. RGB stars are also ideal targets to tackle two controversial and unsolved questions in exoplanet science: the occurrence rate of gas-giant planets as a function of stellar mass and the role of stellar incident flux on the radius inflation of gas-giant planets.
