Title: Probing The Potential High Energy Environment In TheGJ1132 And LHS  1140 Systems

PI: Dittmann, Jason - Massachusetts Institute Of Technology

Type: Small

Summary: Exoplanets around nearby small stars present the best opportunity for future atmospheric studies with the James Webb Space Telescope and the ground based ELTs under construction. While TESS will be monitoring the bright nearby stars for transiting planets, two recent discoveries by MEarth (GJ 1132b and LHS 1140b) will also be visible in the southern ecliptic hemisphere survey. Both of these targets are currently in the JWST GTO programs. However, interpreting the spectra that JWST will soon return requires understanding the energy input at the top of their atmospheres. We propose to utilize TESS s unique capability for continuous monitoring to measure the flare rate and energies from GJ 1132 and LHS 1140 in order to better interpret future atmospheric data.
