Title: Probing Cycle-To-Cycle Variations In The Rise Times Of Rrab Stars

PI: Carrell, Kenneth - Angelo State University

Type: MINI

Summary: TESS observations have provided new and exciting results for pulsating variable stars. In particular, transient changes have been seen in the light curves of RR Lyrae stars. We are proposing to look at a faster cadence at the rise times of RRab stars to look for transient behavior in this interesting and important phase.
