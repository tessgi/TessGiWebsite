Title: A Pilot Study On Stellar Oscillations In Solar-Type Stars Through Simultaneous Intensity And Rv Observations

PI: Li, Yaguang - University Of Hawaii (Manoa)

Type: SMALL

Summary: Stellar oscillations offer a unique window into the internal dynamics of stars and have become the gold-standard for calibrating fundamental stellar properties. These observations trace the time variation of either intensity (through photometry) or radial velocity (though spectroscopy), but almost never with both. However, simultaneously monitoring oscillations using both channels can significantly improve our understanding of stellar interiors and atmospheres, offering constraints that differ from those obtained through either method alone. Here we propose a pioneering set of simultaneous observations of stellar oscillations in solar-type stars to address this critical gap, using TESS and ground-based Extremely Precise Radial Velocity instruments.
