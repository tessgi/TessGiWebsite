# TESS Program G011290

Title: Searching For Transiting Cold Jupiters Around Bright Stars

PI: Crouzet, Nicolas - Instituto De Astrofisica De Canarias

Type: N/A

Summary: Hot Jupiters are complex systems to study because they are coupled to their host stars. The next step in our understanding of gas giant exoplanets will come from the discovery and characterization of transiting cold Jupiters . We conducted a transit survey from Antarctica and identified transit candidates with long orbital periods. We propose to use the TESS mission to confirm these planets. Because of the long transit durations and sparse transit events, TESS is uniquely suited to these observations. In addition, these objects are close to each other so full frame images will contain all of them. This program should yield the discovery of several transiting cold Jupiters that are suitable to characterization and possibly of other aligned transiting planets in these systems.
