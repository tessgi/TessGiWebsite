Title: Ultra-Cool Dwarfs Viewed Equator-On: Surveying The Best Host Stars For Biosignature Detection In Transiting Exoplanets

PI: Metchev, Stanimir - State University Of New York At Stony Brook

Type: Small

Summary: There are ~50 known planets around M dwarfs, but only one system around an ultra-cool (>M7) dwarf: Trappist-1. Ultra-cool dwarfs are arguably the most promising hosts for atmospheric and biosignature detection in transiting planets because of the enhanced feature contrast in transit and eclipse spectroscopy. We propose a pilot TESS survey to continuously monitor six of the brightest ultra-cool dwarfs over 27.4 days. To maximize the probability of detecting transiting planets, we have selected only targets seen close to equator-on. Spin-orbit alignment expectations dictate that the planetary systems around these ultra-cool dwarfs should also be oriented nearly edge-on. Any planet detections in our pilot survey will immediately become top priority targets for JWST transit spectroscopy.
