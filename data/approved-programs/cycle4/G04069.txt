Title: Confirming Ultra-Hot Jupiters From TESS

PI: Jackson, Brian - Boise State University

Type: SMALL

Summary: Ultra-hot Jupiters UHJs present many observational opportunities and theoretical conundra. Their large masses and short periods facilitate follow-up, and observational evidence points to ongoing tidal decay of their orbits, demanding an accurate catalog for long-term monitoring. Their phase curves evince dynamic meteorology involving disassociation, ionization, and magnetic fields. Unfortunately, UHJs are among the most challenging to confirm, but a focused light curve analysis and radial velocity measurements can surmount these difficulties. We propose to use Cycles 1 through 3 TESS data, leavened with ground-based observations and a small number of 2-min cadence observations from Cycle 4, to validate or confirm UHJ candidates and search for phase curves diagnostic of exotic meteorology.
