Title: Asteroseismology Of Bright Solar Analogs

PI: Huber, Daniel - University Of Hawaii (Manoa)

Type: SMALL

Summary: Solar analogs - stars with temperatures, radii and metallicities similar to the Sun - play a critical role for stellar astrophysics and exoplanet science. Asteroseismology provides a powerful tool to determine fundamental properties such as mass and age, but due to their small amplitudes and fast timescales oscillations in solar analogs are only available for a handful of stars using space-based photometry. Here we propose to use the unique 20-second cadence capabilities from TESS to establish the first benchmark sample of bright asteroseismic solar analogs, which will enable us to (i) investigate the connection between magnetic activity cycles and stellar age in Sun-like stars and (ii) characterize the radii and eccentricities of small transiting exoplanets.
