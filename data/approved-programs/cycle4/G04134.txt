Title: TESS Observations Of The Bright Cepheid Polaris

PI: Buzasi, Derek - Florida Gulf Coast University

Type: SMALL

Summary: Polaris, the current North Pole Star, is the brightest Cepheid in the sky, and features a dominant pulsation period of approximately 3.974 days. As the prototypical Classical Cepheid, the star has served as a laboratory for studies of the period-luminosity relationship, stellar pulsation, and massive star evolution for more than a century. Ironically, despite this concentrated study - and over 1100 ADS publications - much remains uncertain about this valuable astrophysical laboratory, including its mass, radius, age, and evolutionary state. TESS provides a unique and crucial opportunity to clarify this confusing situation and to test the stability of Polaris' light amplitude as well as the presence of additional short-timescale variability previously reported for the star.
