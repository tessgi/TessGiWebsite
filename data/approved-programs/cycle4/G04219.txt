Title: Stellar Flares Through Time

PI: Van Saders, Jennifer - University Of Hawaii (Manoa)

Type: SMALL

Summary: Although the flare rates of stars have been well-studied as a function of spectral type, they are much more poorly understood as a function of stellar age. We will use a sample of 400 wide white-dwarf main-sequence (WD-MS) binaries to extend the flare-activity-age relations for low-mass stars using high-fidelity ages (10-30%) from their white dwarf companions. We will leverage these binary systems to investigate the evolution of flare rates with time past 1 Gyr, for the first time with precision ages. Quantifying the flare rate in old stars provides a timeline within which to examine questions about the impact of stellar activity on exoplanet habitability.
