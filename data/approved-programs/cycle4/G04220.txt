Title: Anchoring The Age Scale With Asteroseismic Binaries

PI: Van Saders, Jennifer - University Of Hawaii (Manoa)

Type: SMALL

Summary: We propose to observe nearby, coeval, wide binary systems as fundamental astrophysical calibrators for period-age relations for low-mass (< 0.8 Msun) main sequence stars. We target systems where solar-like oscillations should be detectable in TESS in the F/G primary star, enabling a precise asteroseismic age determination (10-20%), and where the secondary star is of K or M spectral type. 68 such binary systems meet these criteria and are visible in Cycle 4, roughly doubling the sample of asteroseismic age calibrators for period-age relations, and providing the first large sample of seismic calibrators for low-mass stars.
