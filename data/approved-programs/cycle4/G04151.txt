Title: Deciphering The Complex Nature Of Blazar Variability

PI: Raiteri, Claudia - Istituto Nazionale Di Astrofisica (Inaf)

Type: MINI

Summary: Blazars are a class of active galactic nuclei characterized by non-thermal emission from a relativistic jet, with extreme variability properties. Their unpredictable flux changes occur on time scales from minutes to years. It has been claimed that the short-term variability can have a double nature, the fastest events possibly due to energetic processes in jet substructures, while on longer time scales we may see the effect of orientation changes. We propose 2-min cadence TESS observations of one BL Lac object, S5 0716+714, and one flat-spectrum radio quasar, 3C 279. Both sources are optically bright and well-known for their multiwavelength activity. The aim is to dissect the flux behavior on different time scales to reach a deeper knowledge of blazar emission and jet structure.
