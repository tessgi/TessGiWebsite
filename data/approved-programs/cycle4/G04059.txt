Title: Simultaneous Photometric And Doppler Monitoring Of Kepler Targets With TESS And Neid

PI: Robertson, Paul - University Of California (Irvine)

Type: SMALL

Summary: As Doppler spectrometers approach ever higher precision, stellar activity is becoming the most significant challenge when measuring precise masses of exoplanets. Photometry is a valuable tool for mitigating the effects of stellar activity, especially when taken simultaneously with RVs. We propose to observe high-value Kepler targets using the new, ultra-precise Doppler spectrograph NEID, simulatneously with TESS observations. A joint photometry-RV model will be used to mitigate activity in RVs, and provide precise mass estimates for our targets. Models will be run with Kepler photometry, TESS photometry, and both, with a study of the effectiveness of such models being a primary science result. The results of this project will inform future efforts to measure exoplanet masses with RVs.
