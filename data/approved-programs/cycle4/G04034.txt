Title: Diving Into Yellow Supergiants With TESS: Coherent And Stochastic Variability

PI: Dorn-Wallenstein, Trevor - University Of Washington

Type: SMALL

Summary: TESS is collecting unique high cadence, high precision light curves of dozens of yellow supergiants (YSGs). Recent work has found stochastic low-frequency variability (SLFV) to be ubiquitous in YSGs; this variability may be the first direct probe of YSG interiors. We propose to couple ground-based spectroscopy to new and archival TESS data to determine the mechanism driving YSG SLFV, and construct a complete evolutionary sequence of SLFV from main sequence to core collapse. TESS has also revealed a new class of pulsators that are proposed to be massive stars in a second YSG phase. We will use new TESS data to double the number of known YSG pulsators, and use ground-based spectroscopy to constrain their evolutionary status while determining the geometry of the observed modes.
