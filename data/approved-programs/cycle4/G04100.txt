Title: Characterizing V1298 Tau: A System Of Newborn Planets

PI: Murphy, Matthew - University Of Arizona

Type: MINI

Summary: We propose for TESS to observe the V1298 Tau system with 2 minute cadence during Cycle 4. V1298 Tau is notable for having four young (23 Myr) planets. The age and estimated low densities of these planets suggest they are in the end stages of formation when planets radiate away formation heat, contract, and lose some atmosphere. These planets are an excellent laboratory for planetary formation and will be a popular target for atmospheric characterization and to understand formation with JWST. 2 minute cadence data from TESS will reduce transit time uncertainties from several hours to tens of minutes during JWST Cycle 1, enabling transit observations with JWST. The TESS data will also constrain possible transit timing variations, placing an upper limit on the mass of these planets.
