Title: Probing Impulsive Events In Huge Flares At High Cadence

PI: Howard, Ward - University Of North Carolina

Type: SMALL

Summary: Megaflares, stellar flares of 10^35 erg, are among the largest and rarest flares emitted by M-dwarfs. They may fully dissociate Earth-like atmospheres in single events. It is currently unknown how their energy is released as a function of time, especially in the UV. We propose 20 s cadence observations of a large sample of megaflares from active stars across the sky to measure their impulsive emission profiles, coupled with simultaneous ground-based observations of a subset of events to measure flare temperature and constrain UV emission. This will be the first statistically-robust survey of megaflares at high cadence.
