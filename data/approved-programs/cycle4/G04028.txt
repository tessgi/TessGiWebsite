Title: Searching For Shock Signatures And Modeling Pulsation Hydrodynamics Of Galactic Cepheids

PI: Guzik, Joyce - New Mexico Consortium & Los Alamos National Laboratory

Type: SMALL

Summary: We propose observations of 46 bright Galactic Cepheids during TESS Cycle 4, with 2-min cadence desired. Our objective is to search for transient, possibly phased, brightenings in the optical light curves, indicative of pulsation-produced shocks. Hydrodynamic modeling has shown that shocks can plausibly explain X-ray brightenings discovered in delta Cep (phased) and beta Dor using Chandra and XMM observations. Shocks have been proposed to drive mass loss in Cepheids that may help explain the Cepheid mass discrepancy. Our second objective is to carry out nonlinear hydrodynamic modeling using MESA RSP for an ensemble of Galactic Cepheids to understand the origin of cycle-to-cycle period and amplitude variations, bumps, and other features that are being discovered in TESS Cepheid light curves.
