Title: Unraveling The Most Luminous Galactic Explosions With TESS

PI: De, Kishalay - California Institute Of Technology

Type: SMALL

Summary: While classical novae have been known to arise from thermonuclear runaways on the surface of white dwarfs, recent multi-wavelength observations have revealed a shocking new picture involving multiple outflows and powerful shocks that shape every aspect of the eruption. We propose to utilize the novel capabilities of near-infrared surveys to find highly obscured novae together with the red sensitivity of TESS to characterize their multi-wavelength variability across all timescales. Combining TESS light curves of an expected 4 Galactic novae with a dedicated ground based follow-up campaign, we will establish for the first time, the diversity of shocks and outflows in novae as a function of viewing angle and white dwarf mass, and illuminate their effects on the evolution of the binary system.
