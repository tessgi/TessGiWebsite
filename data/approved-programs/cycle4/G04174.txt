Title: Increasing The Impact Of TESS With The All-Sky Automated Survey For Supernovae

PI: Kochanek, Christopher - Ohio State University

Type: LARGE

Summary: TESS is a revolutionary tool for studying transients but only if the transients are first discovered and characterized from the ground due to the delay in the release of TESS data. We will use the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae to identify TESS transients, our team's access to 2m-8m telescopes in characterize them, and our team's broad expertise to analyze them, including the TESS data. There are guaranteed results for both thermonuclear and core-collapse supernovae, and high probabilities of novae, tidal disruption events and blazar flares.
