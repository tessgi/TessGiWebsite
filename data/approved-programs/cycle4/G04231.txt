Title: Expanding The TESS Mission S Legacy Of Long-Period Planets

PI: Dragomir, Diana - University Of New Mexico

Type: SMALL

Summary: We propose to complement TESS core science by adding hundreds of new long-period planets and candidates. We will search Cycle 4 for additional transits of single-transit planet candidates (STPCs) found in Cycle 2 and in K2. We aim to significantly increase the current sample of warm and cold giant exoplanets, and to generate a sample of the coldest M dwarf planets. We will also identify new STPCs in Cycle 4. These candidates will be released to the community to allow efficient follow-up. This program will provide giant planets that will be amenable to follow-up studies, enabling constraints on the composition and formation of long-period exoplanets. As added value, this program will allow us to update the occurrence rates of long-period giant exoplanets.
