Title: The K2 & TESS Synergy: Uniting Nasa'S Planet Hunters

PI: Rodriguez, Joseph - Michigan State University

Type: LARGE

Summary: In the coming years, our ability to characterize the atmospheres of small planets will significantly improve as multiple next generation telescopes and missions are expected to begin operations. Unfortunately, most of the known transiting planets, those particularly valuable for atmospheric studies, have ephemerides that have degraded too much to efficiently schedule observations on these expensive facilities. We propose to globally fit observations from TESS and K2, with any available ground-based radial velocity measurements, for all known planets originally discovered by K2 and have transits detected by TESS. We will release a catalogue of refined ephemerides and system parameters to the community and create self-consistent sample of exoplanet parameters for population studies.
