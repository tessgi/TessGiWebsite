Title: Interiors Of Exoplanets By Constraining The Fluid Love Number K2,F

PI: Hellard, Hugo - Deutsches Zentrum Fur Luft-Und Raumfahrt (Dlr)

Type: N/A

Summary: We propose a method to break down the degeneracy in the mass-radius diagram by measuring the polar flattening of giant exoplanets. The first goal of our investigation is to measure the tide- and rotational-induced polar flattening of giant exoplanets from transit light curves. The second goal is to link this polar flattening to the fluid Love-number k2,f. Oblate-induced disruptions are more pronounced at the ingress/egress phases of short-period planet transits. The duration of these phases for a typical hot-Jupiter lasts for 10 to 20 minutes. Hence, TESS 2-minute cadence measurements are mandatory to reach the required time resolution that allows us to precisely observe these phenomena. Our project provides a third parameter for understanding internal structures of giant exoplanets.
