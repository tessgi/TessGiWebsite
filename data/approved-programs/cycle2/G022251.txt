Title: TESS Observations Of Qes Selected Targets

PI: Tsvetanov, Zlatan - Hamad Bin Khalifa University

Type: SMALL

Summary: We propose to extract and analyze TESS light curves for 242 selected candidate transiting planet systems in the Northern ecliptic sky. All our candidates have been identified by the Qatar Exoplanet Survey and have been screened through follow-up spectroscopy. These light curves will be used to confirm and characterize transiting planets, including giant planets around early type stars and subgiants, to look for additional transit signals, and check for transit timing variations. We propose 2 minute cadence observations for 100 targets which are included in the latest version of the CTL catalog but are not among the top priority targets for the TESS team. The remaining 142 targets will be analyzed using the full-frame images.
