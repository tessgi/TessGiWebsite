Title: Fast Rotation And Flares In The Local Population Of Young K And M Dwarfs

PI: Lepine, Sebastien - Georgia State University

Type: Small

Summary: K2 observations revealed that a significant fraction (>10%) of local field M dwarfs are fast-rotator stars, with periods < 4days. Many of these stars may constitute the long sought-after population of young, low-mass stars in the vicinity of the Sun. Most of them also show evidence of significant flaring activity in the long-cadence K2 light curves. In TESS cycle-1, we used a selection algorithm to identify these potential flaring M dwarfs based on distance, proper motion, and UV-emission; early results show a very high (>60%) success rate in identifying fast-rotating/flaring M dwarfs. In cycle 2, we identify 2,565 of these active field M dwarfs are already target as CTL objects; we propose to add an additional set of 689 nearby active M-dwarfs to achieve a magnitude limited (G<15) sample.
