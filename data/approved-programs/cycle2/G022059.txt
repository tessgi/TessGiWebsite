Title: Studying Turbulence In Jets Of Gamma-Ray Blazars

PI: Jorstad, Svetlana - Boston University

Type: SMALL

Summary: We propose to observe a sample of 24 gamma-ray blazars with TESS, combining FFI and 2-min cadence data. TESS light curves, along with VLBI and polarimetric monitoring that we perform for the sample, will allow us to analyze properties of turbulent plasma in jets of blazars, which have yet to be systematically explored. Inclusion of TESS light curves in our decade-long photometric observations of each blazar is crucial for construction of power spectral densities and determining their characteristics. We will perform a correlation analysis between TESS and Fermi LAT gamma-ray light curves with unprecedented accuracy, providing information on the relative location of gamma-ray and optical emission regions in blazars.
