Title: Legacy Light Curves Of A Volume-Complete Sample Of The Nearby Mid-To-Late M Dwarfs With TESS

PI: Winters, Jennifer - Harvard-Smithsonian Center For Astrophysics

Type: Small

Summary: M dwarfs account for 75% of all stars, yet key stellar properties remain uncertain, notably their magnetic activity and rotation periods. For the coming decade, the only spectroscopically-accessible temperate, terrestrial worlds will be the ones that transit the closest mid-to-late M-dwarfs, which are the most easily studied. We propose to gather TESS 2-minute cadence observations of the volume-complete sample of mid-to-late M dwarfs within 15pc. Short cadence is essential to determine the flare morphologies; we will also measure rotation periods, and precisely measure radii for new-found eclipsing binaries. We will combine the TESS light curves with our ongoing high-resolution spectroscopic survey and existing astrometric data to yield a legacy dataset of our closest stellar neighbors.
