Title: Visitors From The Inner Galaxy: The Age Of Metal Rich Dwarfs

PI: Valentini, Marica - Leibniz-Institut Fur Astrophysik Potsdam (Aip)

Type: Small

Summary: In this proposal, we aim at putting constraints on the Milky Way ISM lithium chemical evolution. It has been proposed that the puzzling lithium decrease at super-solar metallicities could be caused by old stars, originating for the inner parts of the discs, depleting their lithium during their time-travel (Guiglion et al. 2019). Using TESS light curves of 15 selected dwarfs stars (6 of them are super-solar), we plan to derive precise masses, radius and ages, and well as atmospheric parameters and refined lithium abundances from ESO HARPS spectra. If such metal-rich stars are confirmed to be old, this would reinforce the fact that they migrated from the inner-disc, giving additional constraint to the lithium ISM decrease.
