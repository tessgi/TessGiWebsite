Title: Challenging Planet Formation Theories With The Lowest Metallicity TESS Targets

PI: Christiansen, Jessie - NASA Exoplanet Science Institute

Type: Small

Summary: One extremely interesting and relatively unexplored question of exoplanet demographics is that of the occurrence rates of planets around very metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]<&#8722;1). TESS provides a large enough sample of these stars for us to place significant observational constraints on competing planet formation theories. In this proposal, we lay out a plan for calculating robust occurrence rates of planets orbiting very metal-poor stars, using a carefully selected sample of TESS targets. In addition to quantifying their exoplanet occurrence rates, we will provide a legacy of high-precision, well-sampled light curves of these stars, which date back to the birth of the Milky Way.
