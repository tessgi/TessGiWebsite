Title: Constraining Formation Pathways Of Planets Orbiting High-Mass Stars

PI: Ahlers, Johnathon - NASA/GSFC & Usra

Type: Large

Summary: We propose to discover transiting exoplanets orbiting high-mass stars ($M_star >=1.3M_odot$) from TESS's Cycle 2 full-frame images (FFIs) and measure their spin-orbit alignments (the angle between the stellar spin angular momentum and the planetary orbital angular momentum) via gravity-darkening analysis of the TESS light curves. The proposed work will significantly increase the number of spin-orbit alignment measurements for exoplanets with high-mass, early-type host stars, leading to constraints on the mechanisms for misalignment and planet formation and evolution pathways. We also propose high-cadence observations of Kepler-462b to obtain follow-up information on its dynamic behavior.
