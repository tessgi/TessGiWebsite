Title: Starspots And The Origin Of Scatter In The Rotation--Activity Relation

PI: Newton, Elisabeth - Dartmouth College

Type: Small

Summary: Despite their proximity and prevalence, we do not understand the distribution of spots and active regions on M dwarfs. TESS provides a unique opportunity to obtain uniform, high cadence photometry for hundreds of bright M dwarfs with known rotation periods, and enables simultaneous ground-based spectroscopy. We will use these data to investigate the origin of scatter in the rotation--activity relationship for M dwarfs. Namely, we will test for the existence of a tight relationship between the amplitude of photometric variability and magnetic activity as measured by H-alpha. This proposal will support our measurement of rotation periods and photometric amplitudes using the TESS data.
