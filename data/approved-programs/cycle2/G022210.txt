Title: Syndiff: Bayesian Difference Imaging For Optimal TESS Light Curves

PI: Narayan, Gautham - Space Telescope Science Institute

Type: Large

Summary: TESS s continuous 30 minute cadence will provide crucial early time data on explosive transients, probing a window that is inaccessible to traditional ground-based surveys. We propose to identify transients within the TESS sectors with ATLAS and PS1, alert the public, and trigger complementary photometric and spectroscopic follow-up. Our program will determine the types of companions to progenitors of SNe Ia using features in the early LCs; explore the physics of SN using subtle features during their rise; constraint the radius and properties of progenitor stars of core-collapse SNe using the signatures of shock break-out; and constraint the light curves of exotic and rare events like superluminous SNe, tidal disruption events, and fast transients.
