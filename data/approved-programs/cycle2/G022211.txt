Title: Maximizing The TESS Mission&#8242;S Long-Period Planet Yield

PI: Dragomir, Diana - Massachusetts Institute Of Technology

Type: Small

Summary: We propose to complement TESS core science by leveraging NASA s investment in the TESS mission to increase by up to several hundred the yield of long-period planet candidates. We will identify and vet single transit signals likely to have a planetary origin. We will release these candidates to the community in a timely fashion to enable efficient follow-up. This program will provide a large sample of temperate planet candidates transiting bright stars which, if confirmed will be amenable to a variety of follow-up studies. In turn, these studies will place constraints on the composition and formation of long-period exoplanets.
