Title: Cataclysmic Variables And TESS For Cycle 2: Uninterrupted Data!

PI: Schlegel, Eric - University Of Texas At San Antonio

Type: Small

Summary: We propose to use TESS to observe thirteen eclipsing cataclysmic variables. The TESS data will be combined with observations of the eclipses from ground-based telescopes from the Center for Backyard Astrophysics. The TESS data will probe the longer-term behavior of these CVs as shown by the Kepler and K2 observations. TESS will examine a broader range of eclipsing CVs than was possible with Kepler or K2. We pursue subtle systematics in the light curves.
