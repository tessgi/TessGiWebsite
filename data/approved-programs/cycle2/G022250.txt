# TESS Program G022250

Title: A Search For Exoplanets In The Local Halo Population

PI: Lepine, Sebastien - Georgia State University

Type: SMALL

Summary: The TESS mission is not currently targeting any significant number of low-mass stars from the local halo population in the 2-minutes cadence mode. We propose to remedy this situation by targeting 1,213 nearby and relatively bright (G<15) low-mass K and M subdwarfs from the local halo. While local halo stars have been targeted in the K2 mission, with no exoplanet detected, there is a chance that the 2-min cadence data might lead to the detection of Neptune or Jupiter sized planets that would otherwise be overlooked in 30-min cadence mode. Light curves will also likely turn up eclipsing binary systems.
