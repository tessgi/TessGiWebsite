Title: ULTRA-HIGH-SPEED OBSERVATIONS OF WHITE DWARFS IN TESS CYCLE 6

PI: JAMES, HERMES - BOSTON UNIVERSITY

Type: SMALL

Summary: We propose ultrafast, 20-second-cadence observations of several hundred white dwarfs visible in Cycle 6 of the TESS mission. Our proposed 20-second observations will uniquely enable asteroseismology of a large sample of known and high-likelihood pulsating white dwarfs, continuing the space-based revolution into the interiors of pulsating white dwarfs. We also propose to observe a subset of white dwarfs with known rapid variability detected by previous TESS data, including many white dwarfs in eclipsing compact binaries as well as some transiting planetary debris systems. Our proposed science case requires the fastest cadence available from TESS, and will expand the largest catalog of rapid variability in white dwarfs ever created.
