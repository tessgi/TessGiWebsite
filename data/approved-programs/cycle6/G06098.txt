Title: Characterizing Targets For The Habitable Worlds Observatory

PI: Gilbert, Emily - NASA/JPL

Type: SMALL

Summary: One of the main recommendations for the field of exoplanets in the 2020 Astro Decadal Survey is the development of a UV/O/IR facility capable of directly imaging small exoplanets in the habitable zones of their host stars in order to search for biosignatures in their atmospheres. To that end, the Exoplanet Exploration Program office has compiled a list of likely targets for this telescope. We propose to observe these targets visible in TESS Cycle 6 at short (20-second) cadence in order to measure stellar rotation periods, flare rates, and search for planets. It is imperative that we study these stars to the best of our ability now so that we can prioritize the most promising targets in our search for habitable worlds.
