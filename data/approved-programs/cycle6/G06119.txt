Title: Probing Cycle-To-Cycle Pulsation Variations In Rrc Stars Using Simultaneous Spectroscopy And TESS Observations

PI: Wilhelm, Ronald - University Of Kentucky

Type: SMALL

Summary: Our proposal is to secure funding to conduct simultaneous, ground-based, high-resolution spectroscopic observations and TESS Cycle 6 observations of our target RR Lyrae variable stars. Our variable star targets show multi-mode pulsations that are thought to include non-radial pulsation modes. We will compare variations in the stars turbulent and pulsation velocities and velocity gradient to the multi-mode frequencies from a Fourier analysis of the TESS data. This will allow us to test correlations between kinematic and light variations and probe the possible non-radial nature of the multi-mode frequencies. We will also use funds to analyze our current sample of simultaneous observations that were obtained from earlier TESS cycles.
