Title: Simultaneous Spectroscopy And Photometry Of Stellar Flares With TESS And Amateur Astronomers

PI: Buchheim, Robert - Society For Astronomical Sciences

Type: SMALL

Summary: We propose 20-s cadence observations of 9 bright (V~11) and active K and M stars that will be simultaneously observed with the facilities of amateur astronomers. The TESS observations will be combined with ground-based spectroscopy and B and V band photometry to measure flare color temperatures, the energy released via line emission, and distinguish changes in the continuum from emission-line enhancement during flares.
