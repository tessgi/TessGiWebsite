Title: Tess Observations Of Transiting Planet Candidates From HAT 

PI: Bakos, Gaspar - Princeton University

Type: Small

Summary: We propose to extract and analyze TESS light curves for all 1666 candidate transiting planet systems in the Southern ecliptic sky that have been identified by the HAT ground-based transit surveys, and which are not among the top priority TESS targets. These light curves will be used to confirm and characterize transiting planets, including giant planets around M dwarfs, to look for additional transit signals in the light curves, to check for transit timing variations, and to calibrate the follow-up efficiency of the HAT surveys. We propose 2 minute cadence observations for 139 targets where high cadence is necessary, the remaining 1527 targets will be analyzed using the full-frame images.
