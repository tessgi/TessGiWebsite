Title: Putting Our Knowledge Of Cepheids To The Tesst

PI: Engle, Scott - Villanova University

Type: N/A

Summary: Historically, monitoring the evolution of a Cepheid's pulsations required a significant investment of telescope time. The advent of wide field photometric surveys, provides excellent datasets for carrying out period change studies on a large number of Cepheids. However, the observing cadence of most ground-based sky surveys and the day-night cycle prevent the study of short-term, especially cycle-to-cycle, Cepheid period variations and jitter. The original Kepler field contained just one Galactic Cepheid, and K2 has returned data on maybe a dozen more. But at last, TESS will allow us to carry out ultra-high precision, ~month-long (or longer) continuous photometry of the majority of known Galactic Cepheids. This will fundamentally alter our understanding of Cepheid variables.
