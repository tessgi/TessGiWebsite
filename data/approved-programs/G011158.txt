Title: M-Dwarfs Of Interest From Ngts

PI: Bayliss, Daniel - University Of Warwick

Type: N/A

Summary: We propose to use TESS 2-min cadence data to investigate 15 M-dwarfs of interest from the Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS) that show short duration transits/eclipses. These include a confirmed planet (NGTS-1b), a m-dwarf/white dwarf system, and several MM eclipsing binaries. All targets show short timescale events that necessitate 2-minute cadence rather than the 30-minute cadence from the FFIs.
