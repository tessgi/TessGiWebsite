Title: Longevity Of Structure In Complex Rotators In Young Moving Groups

PI: Popinchalk, Mark - American Museum Of Natural History

Type: SMALL

Summary: Recently Kepler K2 and TESS have introduced a new category in young stars: rapidly rotating young M's that show multifarious structure in their light curves. TESS Cycle 5 provides a critical extension to this baseline and will be pivotal in understanding the phenomena further. We are proposing a target list of 42 complex rotators for the TESS Cycle 5 two minute cadence postage stamp observing so that we can further characterize the longevity of the multifarious features in these objects. We also propose to mine the estimated 3120 young M stars within 100pc observed with TESS cycle 5 to identify new complex rotators.
