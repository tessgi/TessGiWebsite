Title: DETECTING AND VETTING PLANET CANDIDATES IN FFI DATA

PI: DOUGLAS CALDWELL - SETI INSTITUTE

Type: SMALL

Summary: We propose to operate an existing pipeline to provide calibrated target pixels, light curves, and full transit search results for more than 150,000 targets per sector selected from the TESS Cycle 5 200 second cadence FFIs. We will provide a machine learning (ML) vetted list of planet candidates from the transit search.
