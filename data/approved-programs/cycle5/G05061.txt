Title: An Acid Test Of Two Stellar Age Dating Methods

PI: Melis, Carl - University Of California (San Diego)

Type: MINI

Summary: We propose an acid test of two "gold standard" methods for deriving ages of main sequence stars with ages greater than roughly 1 Gyr. We will obtain TESS 20 second cadence observations of old stars in wide-separation binary systems with a white dwarf, derive ages for the star from asteroseismology, then compare to ages independently estimated for the white dwarf companion. This will serve as a validation and cross-check for the usage of both methods as accurate chronometers and pave the way for making age estimates for as many single nearby old stars as possible.
