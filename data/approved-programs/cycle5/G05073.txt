Title: A Unique Test Of M-Dwarf Flares With Eclipsing Binaries

PI: Martin, David - Ohio State University

Type: SMALL

Summary: M-dwarfs are popular for exoplanets, owing to a short-period habitable zone and abundance of rocky planets. The promise of M-dwarfs has led to a huge time and money commitment, including from TESS. The sometimes overlooked challenge is that low-mass stars flare frequently and at high amplitude. This not only hinders the detection and characterization of planets and stars, but it endangers any potential life. We propose a unique test of M-dwarf flares by constraining their size and location using short-period eclipsing binaries. With 20 second cadence we will be able to, for the first time, resolve the occultation of a flare with optical light. We can test if flares are equatorial, like on the Sun, or perhaps near the poles. This has implications for habitability and stellar physics.
