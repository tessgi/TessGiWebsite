Title: TESS Observations Of Gamma-Ray Blazars

PI: Jorstad, Svetlana - Boston University

Type: SMALL

Summary: We propose to observe 8 gamma-ray blazars with TESS in a combination of FFI and 2-min cadence data. TESS light curves, along with polarimetric and radio monitoring that we will perform for the sample will allow us to analyze properties of turbulent plasma in jets of blazars that have never been explored previously in this way. This is a continuation of a Cycle 2 program, with the addition of new gamma-ray blazars, which is crucial for sampling their properties across different sub-classes and for theoretical modeling. We will perform a correlation analysis between TESS, FERMI LAT gamma-ray, Swift XRT, and radio light curves, and optical polarization data that will provide with unprecedented accuracy the relative locations of high energy and optical emission regions in the jets of blazars.
