# TESS Program G03185

Title: Ngts M-Dwarfs Of Interest

PI: Bayliss, Daniel - University Of Warwick

Type: SMALL

Summary: We propose to use TESS 2-min cadence data to investigate M-dwarfs of interest from the Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS) that show short duration transits/eclipses. These include confirmed planets transiting M-dwarfs, m-dwarf/white dwarf systems, and MM eclipsing binaries. All targets show short timescale events that necessitate 2-minute cadence rather than the 10-minute cadence from the FFIs.
