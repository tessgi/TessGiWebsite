Title: Photometric Follow-Up Of The Southern Post-Common Envelope Binaries

PI: Merc, Jaroslav - Charles University In Prague

Type: SMALL

Summary: Eclipsing post-common envelope binaries (HW Vir systems) are highly important for resolving the poorly understood, very short-lived common envelope phase of stellar evolution. We apply for the time-resolved photometry of 18 known or newly discovered southern HW Vir systems in order to obtain light curves covering their complete orbit. A combination of the length of observations and 2-minute cadence mode of the TESS will allow to well sample the eclipses in these systems with a short duration. Obtained data will allow us to obtain the orbital parameters with the precision not achievable by the ground-based observations and will be used in the modeling of the unique reflection effect observed in these systems.
