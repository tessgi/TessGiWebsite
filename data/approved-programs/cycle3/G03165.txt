Title: Measuring True Spin-Orbit Angles Of Planets Transiting High-Mass Stars With TESS

PI: Ahlers, Johnathon - NASA/GSFC & Usra

Type: SMALL

Summary: We propose to probe the formation history and orbital evolution of seven giant planets orbiting high-mass stars using TESS photometry. Specifically, we will constrain the planets' current-day orbit geometries by measuring the planets' orbital tilts relative to their host stars' rotation planes (i.e., their true spin-orbit angles). Our findings will contribute toward understanding the mechanisms responsible for causing spin-orbit misalignment. This project will be carried out over six months, measuring the true spin-orbit angles of seven planets in the southern sky that will be observed (or re-observed) during Cycle 3.
