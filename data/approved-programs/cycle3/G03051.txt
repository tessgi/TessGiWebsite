Title: Unraveling The Young Candidate Planetary System CVSO 30

PI: Czesla, Stefan - Universitat Hamburg

Type: SMALL

Summary: We propose to re-observe the active weak-line T-Tauri star CVSO 30 with TESS in Nov. 2020 at 2 min cadence to study the extremely hot, young, and controversial Jupiter candidate CVSO 30 b. A first TESS light curve of the 2.7 Myr old star CVSO 30 shows strong rotational modulation with periodic (0.45 d), transit-like flux dips superimposed on it. An additional very cold jupiter in the system suggests that a recent planet scattering event may have given rise to its current architecture. Combined with ground-based results, the TESS data are consistent with a decline in period of the hot Jupiter, potentially caused by inspiraling. The proposed re-observation is a unique opportunity to study the transit depth and timing, which are indispensable to better understand the system.
