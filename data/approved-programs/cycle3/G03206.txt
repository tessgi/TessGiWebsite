# TESS Program G03206

Title: Short-Term Variability Of Southern Symbiotic Stars

PI: Merc, Jaroslav - Charles University In Prague

Type: SMALL

Summary: We propose the observations of 41 southern symbiotic stars selected from the New Online Database of Symbiotic Variables with a 2-minute cadence mode of TESS during the Cycle 3. Such data provide the unique opportunity to reveal and study the low-amplitude short-term variability of symbiotic stars on the time scales of minutes at unprecedented levels and could be a valuable input to the models the inner regions of symbiotic systems and disks studying physical conditions in them.
