Title: Asteroseismology Of Late-Type Dwarfs

PI: Basu, Sarbani - Yale University

Type: SMALL

Summary: We propose to do an asteroseismic characterization of late-type dwarfs. These stars pulsate very rapidly, and the new 20 second cadence mode of TESS is ideal for observing these stars. There are three science goals of this investigation: (1) To determine the mass, radius and ages of these stars; (2) To examine whether the mass-radius relationship in these lower-mass main-sequence stars is the same those of the earlier-type main-sequence stars; and (3) To extend the age-activity relation to lower masses.
