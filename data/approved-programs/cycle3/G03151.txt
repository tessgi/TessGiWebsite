Title: Planetary Archaeology: Exploring The Planet Population Around Evolved Stars With TESS

PI: Grunblatt, Samuel - American Museum Of Natural History

Type: SMALL

Summary: Stars undergo dramatic changes as they evolve into red giants, providing a unique opportunity to study the response of exoplanets to changing irradiation, tides and mass loss in a manner that is not possible on the main sequence. We propose to use TESS full-frame images to detect and characterize giant planets transiting red giant stars. Our program combines transits, asteroseismology and radial velocities to address key questions such as (i) the occurrence of giant planets as a function of stellar mass, metallicity and evolutionary state and (ii) the mechanism(s) responsible for the inflation of hot Jupiters. We propose to continue the first near-all-sky survey that combines asteroseismology and transit photometry to precisely characterize exoplanets orbiting evolved stars.
