Title: TESS Asteroseismology Of The Eclipsing Subgiant AI  Phe

PI: Creevey, Orlagh - Observatoire De La Cote D'Azur

Type: SMALL

Summary: There are very few stars for which the results of asteroseismology can be compared to independently measured masses and/or radii. Among the list of well-studied stars in eclipsing binary systems we found only one system (AI Phe) for which asteroseismology of the subgiant component is feasible using TESS data (periods peak near 1440s). Only TESS is capable of providing these data. This star was observed during Cycle01, we did not detect oscillations. We would like to reobserve this star in order to combine Cycle01 and Cycle03 data and improve the detection probability.
