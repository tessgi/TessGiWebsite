Title: Multiple Earth-Sized Habitable Zone Planets In Toi-700?

PI: Rodriguez, Joseph - Harvard-Smithsonian Center For Astrophysics

Type: SMALL

Summary: Recently, a system of three small planets were discovered orbiting the early M-dwarf, TOI-700. The two inner planets, TOI-700 b and c, are sub-Neptune in size (1.04 and 2.65 Earth radii) and orbit with periods of 9.98 and 16.05 days. However, the third planet in the system, TOI-700 d, is only 20% larger than the Earth and orbits within the conservative habitable zone of its star with a period of 37.5 day. With extensive characterization observations in progress or being planned, we want to improve our understanding of the TOI-700 architecture and study any short duration flaring activity that could significantly impact the potential for habitability and would have been missed in the 2-minute cycle 1 observations. Therefore, we propose for 20-second cadence observations of TOI-700 to discov
