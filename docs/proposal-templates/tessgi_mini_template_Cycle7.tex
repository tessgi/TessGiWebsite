%%%%% Included packages %%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\usepackage{graphics,graphicx}
\usepackage[colorlinks]{hyperref}
\hypersetup{urlcolor=blue}
\usepackage{cleveref}

%% Feel free to modify the included packages list to use your
%% favorite packages. 

%% In the graphics and graphicx packages, Postscript and eps figures
%% can be included using the \includegraphics command. The graphics
%% package is part of standard LaTeX2e and provides a basic way of including a
%% figure. The graphicx package is not standard, but extends the
%% \includegraphics command to make it more user-friendly. If graphicx
%% is not available on your system please remove it from the list of
%% included packages above.  

%% Syntax:
%% In the graphics package:
%%
%% \begin{figure}
%% \includegraphics[llx,lly][urx,ury]{file}
%% \end{figure}
%%
%% where ll denotes 'lower left' and ur 'upper right' and the x and y
%% values are the coordinates of the PostScript bounding box in
%% points. There are 72 points in an inch.
%%
%% In the graphicx package:
%% 
%% \begin{figure}
%% \includegraphics[key=val,key=val,...]{file}
%% \end{figure}
%%
%% where some of the useful keys are: angle, width, height,
%% keepaspectratio (='true' or 'false') and scale. Bounding box values
%% can be given as [bb=llx lly urx ury].
%%
%% In either case you have to use LaTeX figure placement commands to
%% position the figure on the page; \includegraphics will not do
%% that. Both these commands also have other options that are listed
%% in the LaTeX manual (for the graphics package) and in 'The LaTeX
%% Graphics Companion' (for the graphicx package).

%%%%% The text below should be commented out before submitting your proposal %%%%% 
\noindent{The recommended sections for a \tess\ GI proposal are shown below. Feel free to change section 
headings as necessary, but this is the suggested minimal information that should be included in the proposal. 
This Science/Technical section of the proposal is limited to 2 pages. Figures are included in these page limits, but not references or a (sample) target table. \\

\noindent Note that the Phase-1 proposal review will be done in a dual-anonymous fashion and follow the guidelines listed below:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Proposals should eliminate language that identifies the proposers or institution, as discussed in the \href{https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/dual-anonymous-peer-review}{Guidelines for Anonymous Proposals}.
    \item PIs are required to upload a one-page \href{https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/docs/proposal-templates/tessgi\_teamexpertise\_template\_cycle5.tex}{Team Expertise} PDF through a separate upload when submitting the science justification into ARK/RPS.
    \item Proposals that do not follow these dual-anonymous guidelines may be returned without review.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Mini proposals are intended for requests for a small number of target slots and require minimal resources, up to 50 20-second cadence targets and 1,000 2-minute cadence targets. Proposals in this category are not eligible for funding.\\ 

\noindent Mini proposals cannot have Targets of Opportunity, a joint component with \hst, \swift, \fermi, or \nicer ~ or have a ground-based component.

\section{Scientific Justification and Perceived Impact}

Provide text and figures that justify the scientific need for \tess\ observations and analyses here. In particular, justify your choice of new 2~min or 20~s cadence observations. If you will also be making use of the 200~s FFIs for your research, make it clear why the \tess\ FFI data are suitable for your science.


Summarize the expected science return of the proposed investigations and the expected benefit to the community.



\section{Analysis Plan and Technical Feasibility}

Discuss how you plan to analyze the \tess\ data. Provide text and figures showing that the proposed \tess\ investigations are feasible; consider the 
\tess\ survey strategy, target observability, and required signal-to-noise, etc. The \tess\ Science 
Support Center (\href{https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/}{TSSC}) makes several tools available to help estimate these quantities. 


\section{References}

List of references. References {\it are {\bf not} included} when considering the
proposal page limit. References in the text should be in the number format, and in the references list as:

[1] Person A, Person B, Person C, et al., 2016, ApJ 200, 231, 2\\

[2] Person D \& Person E, 1912, Nature 495, 452


\section{Target Table}

When necessary to justify your proposal, provide a list of targets using the below example as a template for format. This target table is designed to aid reviewers and need only provide a representative sample of the complete target list uploaded to RPS. Full target tables should be submitted electronically with the Phase-1 proposal. Please limit any target table included here to only 1 page. The table is not included in the page limit of the Science/Technical section.

\noindent TESS GI proposals must provide \href{https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/open-science/science-information-policy_faq/}{Open Science and Data Management Plan (OSDMP)}. In the OSDMP proposers must clearly describe the plans to make any new software, higher level data
products and/or supporting data publicly available. Software developed with TESS GI
funds must add value to the TESS science community, be freely available, and have the
source code openly accessible. Proposals that would create software must discuss in their OSDMP
what practices they will follow to develop any tooling. This includes how tools will be
distributed, version controlled, tested, and documented. 

The OSDMP can be no more than 2-pages long, and \textit{does not} count against the page limit for Scientific/Technical/Management. Proposers should refer to the following documents when preparing their OSDMPs:\\

\textbf{Applicable Policies and Requirements:}

    \item \href{https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/open-science/science-information-policy_faq/}{SMD Information Policy FAQ}
  
\end{itemize}

\noindent If there are costs associated with performing the proposed OSDMP tasks, those costs must be accounted for in the proposal budget and/or budget justification. 

Italicized text below is included for explanatory purposes throughout this template and should be omitted from the OSDMP. This template provides one example of the format and contents of an OSDMP.

Questions about OSDMPs can be sent to SARA@nasa.gov or the program scientist Hannah Jang-Condell (hannah.jang-condell@nasa.gov).

\section{Data Management Plan}

A data management plan is required for all SMD-funded activities that are expected to produce scientific data. Here it is incorporated into the broader OSDMP. Follow any specific requirements for the data management plan that are provided by the funding solicitation or relevant SMD Division. At a minimum, the DMP includes the following elements:

\subsection{Expected data types, formats, volumes, and standards}

Describe the data expected to be produced from the proposed activities. Include the types of data to be produced, the approximate amount of each data type expected, the machine-readable format of the data, data file format, and any applicable standards for the data or associated metadata.

\subsection{Repositories and timeline for sharing data}

Specify the repository(ies) that will be used to archive and provide public access to data and metadata arising from the activities and the schedule for making data publicly available. Include a description of how data will be archived to enable long-term preservation.

\subsection{Description of data types that are exempt from data sharing requirements}

Specify data types that are excluded from requirements to make the data publicly available and cite the relevant laws, regulations, or policies that generate the exclusion.

\section{Software Management}

A software management plan is required for all SMD-funded activities that are expected to produce software. Here it is incorporated into the broader OSDMP. Follow any specific requirements for the software management plan that are provided by the funding solicitation or SMD Division. If the activity is not expected to produce software, include a statement such as: “No software development is anticipated for this effort. If software is created, it will be made publicly available to the extent legally permitted per the Scientific Information Policy for the Science Mission Directorate.”

\subsection{Expected software types}

Describe the software expected to be produced from the proposed activities, including types of software to be produced, how the software will be developed, and the addition of new features or updates to existing software. This can include the platforms used for development, project management, and community-based best practices to be included such as documentation, testing, dependencies, and versioning.

\subsection{Repositories and timeline for sharing software}

Specify the repository(ies) that will be used to archive software arising from the activities and the schedule for making software publicly available. This should include the license under which the software will be made available. If there are no other restrictions, the software should be released under a permissive license.

\subsection{Description of software that are exempt from software sharing requirements}

Specify software types that are excluded from requirements to make the software publicly available and cite the relevant laws, regulations, or policies that generate the exclusion.

\section{Open Science Plan}

\subsection{Publication Sharing}

Describe the types of publications that are expected to be produced from the activities (e.g., peer reviewed manuscripts, technical reports, conference materials, and books). Outline the methods expected to be used to make the publications publicly available, which will likely include options listed under ‘How to Share Publications’ in the SMD Open-Source Science Guidance. This may include posting manuscripts to community-appropriate preprint servers, making accepted manuscripts publicly available in NASA's STI Repository, or publishing manuscripts as Open Access in reputable journals. Note that costs for Open Access publishing may be included in proposal budgets.

\subsection{Other Open Science Activities}

Optionally, the OSDMP may include a description of additional open science activities associated with the project (if not described elsewhere in a proposal). This may include: holding scientific workshops and meetings openly to enable broad participation, providing project personnel with open science training or enablement, implementing practices that support the inclusion of broad, diverse communities in the scientific process as close to the start of research activities as possible if not described elsewhere, and contributions to or involvement in open-science communities.

\section{Roles and Responsibilities}

Specify the project personnel who will ensure the implementation of the OSDMP. This may be its own section or integrated into the sections above.
