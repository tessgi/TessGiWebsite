%%%%% DOCUMENT FORMAT %%%%%

%% The default font was chosen to be easily readable while allowing
%% sufficient material to be included.

%% There are three documentclass commands provided below. Please
%% uncomment the version you would like to use and comment out the
%% others.

%% Please note that the proposal will be printed on US Letter size paper,
%% 8.5 in x 11 in, and that formatting the text for other sizes will
%% generally cause layout problems and may result in text being cut
%% off near the edges. PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THE 'LETTERPAPER' OPTION
%% IN THE DOCUMENTCLASS COMMAND.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%% Default format: 12pt single column %%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%% Minimum margin size is 1 inch from top, bottom, and sides.
%% Font size: see NASA Guidebook for Proposers

%%%%% HOW TO INCLUDE FIGURES %%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% Please see the ``Included packages'' section below.

%%%%% Included packages %%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\usepackage{graphics,graphicx}
\usepackage[colorlinks]{hyperref}
\hypersetup{urlcolor=blue}
\usepackage{cleveref}

%% Feel free to modify the included packages list to use your
%% favorite packages. 

%% In the graphics and graphicx packages, Postscript and eps figures
%% can be included using the \includegraphics command. The graphics
%% package is part of standard LaTeX2e and provides a basic way of including a
%% figure. The graphicx package is not standard, but extends the
%% \includegraphics command to make it more user-friendly. If graphicx
%% is not available on your system please remove it from the list of
%% included packages above.  

%% Syntax:
%% In the graphics package:
%%
%% \begin{figure}
%% \includegraphics[llx,lly][urx,ury]{file}
%% \end{figure}
%%
%% where ll denotes 'lower left' and ur 'upper right' and the x and y
%% values are the coordinates of the PostScript bounding box in
%% points. There are 72 points in an inch.
%%
%% In the graphicx package:
%% 
%% \begin{figure}
%% \includegraphics[key=val,key=val,...]{file}
%% \end{figure}
%%
%% where some of the useful keys are: angle, width, height,
%% keepaspectratio (='true' or 'false') and scale. Bounding box values
%% can be given as [bb=llx lly urx ury].
%%
%% In either case you have to use LaTeX figure placement commands to
%% position the figure on the page; \includegraphics will not do
%% that. Both these commands also have other options that are listed
%% in the LaTeX manual (for the graphics package) and in 'The LaTeX
%% Graphics Companion' (for the graphicx package).
