<p>The TESS Guest Investigator (GI) program is intended to enable the community to participate in science investigations using TESS. The program enables teams to propose the collection of new 2-minute and 20-second cadence targets, and provides funding to US investigators to analyze 2-minute and 20-second cadence and full-frame image (FFI) data. All proposals are managed by the <a href="helpdesk.html">GI office</a>.</p>
<p>The TESS <a href="primary.html">primary mission</a> duration was two years. The first year was spent in the southern ecliptic hemisphere and corresponded to TESS GI program Cycle 1; the second year observed the northern ecliptic hemisphere and corresponded to Cycle 2. During the primary mission, the majority of the 2-minute cadence targets observed were taken from the <a href="#candidate-target-list-ctl">TESS Candidate Target list (CTL)</a>. Around 20,000 2-minute cadence target slots were assigned to the GI program during the 2-year prime mission</p>
<p>Cycle 3 corresponds to the third year of TESS science, and is the first year of the TESS <a href="extended.html">extended mission</a>. There is no primary mission science during the TESS extended mission, scientific investigations are primarily supported by the TESS GI program. Cycle 3 began in July 2020 with targets observed in the southern ecliptic hemisphere.</p>
<p>There is no exclusive-use data rights to observations collected by TESS. All data is made available through the <a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/tess/summary.html">MAST public archive</a> once data processing and validation is complete.</p>
<p><strong>The Cycle 4 call will come out in the fall of 2020, however the solicitation can already be found <a href="https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/viewrepositorydocument/cmdocumentid=735965/solicitationId=%7B4B9CAAB3-D398-183A-B1F3-EF963DF415C7%7D/viewSolicitationDocument=1/ROSES%202020%20SoS%20Guidebook%20062320.pdf">here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Below we describe some of the GI products available in the extended mission and how to propose for Cycle 4 time.</p>
<h2 id="proposal-products">Proposal Products</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A new 20-second cadence mode is now available as part of the extended mission. Approximately 1,000 target slots per sector are available in this mode.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As in the primary mission 2-minute cadence targets are available, but with a 10-fold increase. More than 15,000 target slots are available in each sector. For Cycle 3 there were a total of ~200,000 target slots, facilitating very large GI programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Full-frame images are also available, but with a cadence reduced from 30 minutes to 10 minutes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="proposal-types">Proposal Types</h2>
<p>There are typically three categories of TESS GI proposals; investigators are free to select the category that best reflects their scope of their proposed work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Small proposals - proposals of limited scope.</li>
<li>Large proposals - proposals of wide-ranging scope and science yield. Large proposals must deliver a clear benefit for the broader scientific community.</li>
<li>Key projects - large multi-year programs with a very broad scope. These were a new proposal category that were available in Cycle 3 only and have a maximum duration of 27 months. </li>
</ul>
<p>Note that Large programs and Key Projects have a five-page limit for the scientific/technical/management section, references are not included in the page limits. Other proposals have a four page limit.</p>
<p>Within the small and large programs there are additional kinds of projects that can be put forward, these are described below.</p>
<h3 id="ground-based-observation-focused-projects">Ground-based observation focused projects</h3>
<p>Proposals that support the acquisition and analysis of scientific data from ground-based telescopes are solicited. Such ground-based measurements must directly support the analysis and/or interpretation of TESS scientific data. Ground-based focused proposals should be identified in ARK/RPS as such and will be reviewed in a panel separately from other proposals submitted to the TESS GI program. All size programs are encouraged, and proposers should identify their program as a Small or Large program.</p>
<h3 id="joint-hst-and-swift-programs">Joint HST and Swift programs</h3>
<p>To foster correlative observations, TESS has established joint observing programs with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory.
Proposals for joint HST observations should be submitted through the HST GO program and the TESS targets will be recommended by that review.</p>
<p>The TESS Guest Investigator program can also award Swift observations through a joint program with the Swift mission. Observing time under this program will be awarded
only to proposals that require use of both observatories to meet the primary science goals. Up to 100 ks Swift time will be available through this program. </p>
<p>TESS GI funding is available to successful U.S.-based investigators who request Swift observing time through the TESS GI process. No funds will be awarded from the Swift project for joint
investigations proposed to this TESS program element. These proposals will be evaluated on their technical feasibility by members of the Swift team. Proposers should consult the <a href="https://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/">Swift website</a> for information on Swift.</p>
<h3 id="core-science-targets">Core science targets</h3>
<p>During the extended mission there are no reserved targets or restricted science areas.
Proposals aimed at detecting small planets in 2-minute cadence data are therefore now solicited.</p>
<h2 id="availability-of-funds">Availability of funds</h2>
<p>It is anticipated that &gt; $3.0M will be available in Cycle 4. Note that additional unfunded GI targets may be selected and observed, if target resources permit. TESS 2-minute and 20-second cadence observations are open to all scientists at U.S. or non-U.S. institutions. TESS GI funding is open to all individuals who are identified as Principal Investigators and employed at U.S. institutions. Scientists participating in the TESS mission, including members of the Follow-up Team, are permitted to propose to the GI program and are subject to the same program rules as the rest of the science community. </p>
<p>The dollar amounts assigned to each proposal category are maximum award amounts and are roughly listed below,</p>
<ul>
<li>Small proposals - $70,000. </li>
<li>Large proposals - $250,000.</li>
<li>Ground-based projects - $500,000</li>
</ul>
<p>Funding for selected programs typically starts upon availability of data to the public archive at <a href="data-access.html">MAST</a>. Note that there is no exclusive use period associated with any TESS data. </p>
<h2 id="writing-the-proposal">Writing the proposal</h2>
<p>The GI office welcomes proposals addressing compelling scientific questions in almost any area of astrophysics and planetary science provided the required observations are amenable to the operational characteristics and constraints of the mission. The science motivation may include, but is not limited to; exoplanet detection and characterization, stellar astrophysics, galactic and extragalactic astrophysics, and solar system science. </p>
<p>The primary purpose of the TESS Guest Investigator Program is to enhance and maximize the science return from TESS. The program facilitates and supports both 2-minute and 20-second cadence observations with TESS and research undertaken with the FFIs. Any area of astrophysics may be proposed.</p>
<p>Proposals may utilize any combination of 2-minute cadence, 20-second cadence, and the full-frame image data. All science proposals must be compelling and carefully justified scientifically and technically. </p>
<h3 id="evaluation-criteria">Evaluation criteria</h3>
<p>When writing a proposal the user should consider the following,</p>
<ul>
<li>The scientific justification of a GI proposal should focus on a compelling investigation that requires the collection of new TESS data or new ground-based data that supports the analysis and/or interpretation of TESS data.</li>
<li>The proposed TESS Guest Investigation must clearly enhance the science return of the TESS mission.</li>
<li>The proposal may include limited theoretical components, software development and/or data simulation that strengthens the proposal.<ul>
<li>Proposals must clearly describe the plans to make any new software, higher level data products and/or supporting data publicly available</li>
<li>Software developed with TESS GI funds must add value to the TESS science community, be free, and open source.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At least 70% of the work effort should be focused on exploiting TESS data products, except in the case of ground-based observing focused proposals.</li>
<li>Proposals that are focused on ground-based observing programs must have a clear science driver and describe how the ground-based component is both feasible and required for analysis and/or interpretation of TESS data.<ul>
<li>Ground-based data collected with TESS GI funding support must be made publicly available in a timely fashion at either the NASA Exoplanet Science  Institute (NExScI) <a href="https://exofop.ipac.caltech.edu">ExoFOP service</a> or as a <a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/hlsp/">MAST High-Level Science Product</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other data products created with TESS GI funding support should be archived as a MAST High-Level Science Product (http://archive.stsci.edu/hlsp/).</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition proposals submitted in response to the <a href="https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/viewrepositorydocument/cmdocumentid=735965/solicitationId=%7B4B9CAAB3-D398-183A-B1F3-EF963DF415C7%7D/viewSolicitationDocument=1/ROSES%202020%20SoS%20Guidebook%20062320.pdf">Cycle 4 GI call</a> will be evaluated with respect to the criteria specified in Section C.2 of the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/nraguidebook/">NASA Guidebook for Proposers</a>, which are intrinsic merit, relevance to the GI solicitation, and the realism/reasonableness of the proposed work effort and resources. Intrinsic merit includes the following factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>The suitability of using the TESS survey and data products for the proposed investigation (not applicable for ground-based observing focused programs, although ground-based programs should make clear the need for ground-based data in order to analyze or interpret TESS data);</li>
<li>The suitability of using the TESS survey and data products for the proposed investigation </li>
<li>The degree to which the proposed investigation places demands upon mission resources (this includes justification of the observing cadence requested and the impact on science if a given observing mode is not available during Cycle 4); and</li>
<li>The degree to which the proposed investigation capitalizes on the unique capabilities of TESS.</li>
</ul>
<p>Proposers must take into account the difference between science that can be achieved exclusively using full-frame image data and science that requires new observations at 2-minute and 20-second cadence. </p>
<p>Example proposal templates can be found <a href="proposal-templates.html">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="eligibility">Eligibility</h2>
<p>Application to the TESS GI program is typically open to all investigators, including those from outside the U.S. under NASA's no-exchange-of-funds policy. </p>
<p>Investigators who are not affiliated with a U.S. institution are not eligible for funding through this program, but may submit proposals that will be reviewed and ranked along with eligible proposals for the purpose of allocating targets.</p>
<p>Funding through the NASA TESS GI Program is available only to scientists at U.S. institutions who are identified as the Principal Investigators (PIs). U.S. based Co-Investigators (Co-Is) on foreign-led proposals do not qualify for funding. Funding for accepted target proposals will be initiated only after the relevant observations have begun. Proposers from non-U.S. institutions are strongly encouraged to include a letter of commitment promising financial support.</p>
<p>In accordance with Public Law 113--76, Division B, Title V, Section 532, NASA cannot support bilateral participation, collaboration, or coordination with China or any Chinese-owned company or entity, whether funded or performed under a no-exchange-of-funds arrangement. See Section III(c) of the ROSES-2016 NRA for more information on these restrictions. </p>
<p>The PI of a Phase-1 proposal does not need to be the same as the Phase-2 PI for the budget proposal. A Phase-1 PI is not required to be eligible to hold a grant at their institution. This enables junior scientists to PI Phase-1 proposals.</p>
<h2 id="target-selection">Target Selection</h2>
<p>Investigators can use the tools listed on the <a href="data-access.html">Accessing TESS data products page</a> to aid them in selecting targets. Note the TESS GI program office requires that if a target is in the <a href="data-access.html#TESS Input Catalog (TIC)">TIC</a>, GI proposers must provide only the following columns from the TIC in comma separated value (csv) format:</p>
<ul>
<li>TIC ID (if available)</li>
<li>Right Ascension (decimal degrees)</li>
<li>Declination (decimal degrees)</li>
<li>Proper motion in Right Ascension (mas/yr)</li>
<li>Proper motion in Declination  (mas/yr)</li>
<li>TESS mag</li>
</ul>
<p>additional columns that should be included if necessary are</p>
<ul>
<li>Common name of target</li>
<li>Extended flag</li>
<li>Special handling flag</li>
<li>20-second cadence flag</li>

<p>Additional proposal tools can  be found on our <a href="data-access.html">data access page</a> with proposal tips provided <a href="proposal-tips.html">here</a>. We encourage users to follow <a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/tess/tutorials/goddard_format.html">this custom tutorial</a> provided by the MAST.</p>
<p>We have provided two example target tables with the format we require.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="data/MAST_TIC_Proxima_Cen.csv">A sample of stars around Proxima Cen</a></li>
<li><a href="data/omega_cen_target_table_ex.csv">The whole of globular cluster Omega Cen</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="moving-targets">Moving targets</h3>
<p>Moving aperture targets should be flagged as requiring special handling at proposal submission. Specify in the comments of the target list that this is a moving target. The proposal should discuss in the science case both the minimum and ideal acceptable duration of observations of the target. We will work with the proposal team to generate a delivery format for their targets of interest. Note that this is only necessary if 2-minute/20-second cadence data is requested. </p>
<h2 id="target-of-opportunity-observations">Target of Opportunity Observations</h2>
<p>Target of Opportunity Observations (TOOs) are designated for rapidly evolving phenomena whose occurrence is not predictable at the time of the proposal deadline. Due to TESS mission constraints, TOO-triggered target definitions can only be uploaded to the spacecraft during uplinks that occur once every 13.7 days. Details regarding the circumstances in which a TOO is "triggered" must be included in the scientific justification and on the target form. TOO proposals must also include an estimated duration of the event, as well as an estimated probability for triggering the observations; the latter will be used in the accounting of total allocated targets. TOOs remain active during the current cycle; TOOs not carried out during the cycle may be re-proposed to subsequent solicitations. TOO observations would commence after the spacecraft upload following the trigger event, which could be as long as 2 months after the event. The impact to science of such a potential delay must be addressed in proposals requesting TOO observations. </p>
<h2 id="submission-process">Submission process</h2>
<p>The TESS GI program uses a two-phase proposal process. A Phase-1 proposal shall comprise the science/technical justification; proposals requesting funds need to include a budget narrative, describing in sufficient detail how the proposed funds will be used to achieve the goals outlined in the proposal. Only proposers whose Phase-1 proposals are accepted will be invited to submit budget proposals in Phase-2. It is not necessary for the PI of the Phase-2 proposal to be the science PI. Proposal content, including the list of investigators, should remain consistent between Phase-1 and Phase-2 proposals. All proposal materials will be submitted electronically. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All Proposers must submit their Phase-1 proposals electronically through the <a href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/ark/rps/">Astrophysics Research Knowledge-base (ARK)/ Remote Proposal System (RPS) website</a>. If you haven't used ARK/RPS before, we suggest signing up for an account well before the GI proposal deadline; please refer to <a href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/ark/tess/help.html">the ARK/RPS instructions for TESS</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must "verify" the form, and pass the checks, before you can submit your proposal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Target tables for 2-min/20-second cadence observation proposals are to be submitted through ARK/RPS. There are two different ways to provide your target list: into the RPS target form itself, or as a separate CSV file upload - the latter will only become possible after you submit your RPS form. We strongly encourage proposers to submit a CSV file for target lists containing over 100 targets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Scientific/Technical/Management section of proposals is limited to 4 pages for small programs and 5 pages for large programs, which <em>does not</em> includes references. No table of contents in the body of the proposal is required. No supporting material [e.g., curriculum vitae (CV), pending/current support] is required or permitted. An additional page can be used for a target table only.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optional <a href="#proposal-templates">templates for the Scientific/Technical/Management are available below</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Scientific/Technical/Management section must be uploaded to the RPS website as a PDF file <em>after</em> you have submitted your RPS proposal form.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All proposal materials must be submitted electronically by 4:30 p.m. Eastern time on the due date for this program given in Section 3 in order to be included in the proposal review for this cycle of the TESS Guest Investigator program. Note that the 4:30 p.m. deadline supersedes the deadline stated in the Guidebook for Proposers and in the ROSES Summary of Solicitation. </p>
<p>NASA uses a single, uniform set of instructions for the submission of ROSES proposals. These instructions are given in the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/nraguidebook/">NASA Guidebook for Proposers</a>. TESS GI Proposers should follow these instructions, except where they are overridden by the instructions given in the ROSES Summary of Solicitation.</p>
<h2 id="review-process">Review process</h2>
<p>All proposals are peer-reviewed and ranked by a panel of professional volunteers, followed by ratification from NASA Headquarters. The members of the peer-review panel will not be disclosed. The deliberations of the panel will be disclosed to PIs only after ratification by the selecting official. We anticipate that all proposals focused on ground-based observing will be reviewed by a single panel.</p>
<p>NASA recognizes and supports the benefits of having diverse and inclusive
scientific, engineering, and technology communities and fully expects that such values
will be reflected in the composition of all panels and teams including peer review panels
(science, engineering, and technology), proposal teams, science definition teams, and
mission and instrument teams.</p>
